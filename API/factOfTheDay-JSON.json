Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a <i>chain</i>, with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are resistant to alteration because, once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be changed retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks and obtaining network consensus to accept these changes.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Blockchain"}],"year":2009},{"text":"Flash Airlines Flight 604 crashed shortly after departure from Sharm El Sheikh International Airport which killed all 148 occupants on board.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Flash_Airlines_Flight_604","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Flash Airlines Flight 604</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1427211","titles":{"canonical":"Flash_Airlines_Flight_604","normalized":"Flash Airlines Flight 604","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Flash Airlines Flight 604</span>"},"pageid":419544,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/FLASH_AIRLINES_BOEING_737-300_SU-ZCF.jpg/330px-FLASH_AIRLINES_BOEING_737-300_SU-ZCF.jpg","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/FLASH_AIRLINES_BOEING_737-300_SU-ZCF.jpg","width":1062,"height":708},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1330813103","tid":"48f7c767-e80a-11f0-b1ac-71b65793f4eb","timestamp":"2026-01-02T18:38:52Z","description":"2004 aviation accident in the Red Sea","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":27.83333333,"lon":34.38333333},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Airlines_Flight_604","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Airlines_Flight_604?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Airlines_Flight_604?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Flash_Airlines_Flight_604"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Airlines_Flight_604","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Flash_Airlines_Flight_604","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Airlines_Flight_604?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Flash_Airlines_Flight_604"}},"extract":"Flash Airlines Flight 604 was a charter flight from Sharm El Sheikh International Airport in Egypt to Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris, France, with a stop-over at Cairo International Airport, provided by Egyptian private charter company Flash Airlines.
