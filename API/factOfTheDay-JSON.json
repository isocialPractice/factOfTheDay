In comparison to all the U.S. states and territories, Utah, with a population of just over three million, is the 13th largest by area, the 30th most populous, and the 11th least densely populated. Urban development is mostly concentrated in two regions: the Wasatch Front in the north-central part of the state, which includes the state capital, Salt Lake City, and is home to roughly two-thirds of the population; and Washington County in the southwest, which has approximately 180,000 residents. Most of the western half of Utah lies in the Great Basin.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Utah"},{"type":"standard","title":"Dugway_sheep_incident","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Dugway sheep incident</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2917700","titles":{"canonical":"Dugway_sheep_incident","normalized":"Dugway sheep incident","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Dugway sheep incident</span>"},"pageid":14435745,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/A0112shee.jpg","width":260,"height":208},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/A0112shee.jpg","width":260,"height":208},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1275564592","tid":"f885533f-ea42-11ef-a11c-1edc45d15589","timestamp":"2025-02-13T19:44:43Z","description":"1968 mass killing of sheep in Utah, U.S.","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugway_sheep_incident","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugway_sheep_incident?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugway_sheep_incident?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dugway_sheep_incident"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugway_sheep_incident","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Dugway_sheep_incident","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugway_sheep_incident?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dugway_sheep_incident"}},"extract":"The Dugway sheep incident, also known as the Skull Valley sheep kill, was a March 1968 sheep kill that has been connected to United States Army chemical and biological warfare programs at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah.
