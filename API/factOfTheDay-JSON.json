Freemasonry is the oldest secular fraternity in the world and among the oldest still-existing organisations in history. Modern Freemasonry broadly consists of three main traditions:</p><ul><li><b>Anglo-American style Freemasonry</b>, which insists that a \"volume of sacred law\", such as the Bible, Quran or other religious text should be open in a working lodge, that every member should profess belief in a supreme being, that only men should be admitted, and discussion of religion or politics does not take place within the lodge.</li>\n<li><b>Continental Freemasonry</b> or Liberal Freemasonry which has continued to evolve beyond these restrictions, particularly regarding religious belief and political discussion.</li>\n<li><b>Women Freemasonry</b> or Co-Freemasonry, which includes organisations that either admit women exclusively or accept both men and women. Women Freemasonry can lean both Liberal or Conservative, sometime requiring a religion or not depending on the Grand Orient or Obedience.</li></ul>","normalizedtitle":"Freemasonry"},{"type":"standard","title":"Premier_Grand_Lodge_of_England","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Premier Grand Lodge of England</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1637868","titles":{"canonical":"Premier_Grand_Lodge_of_England","normalized":"Premier Grand Lodge of England","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Premier Grand Lodge of England</span>"},"pageid":10559935,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Seal_of_the_Moderns_Grand_Lodge.jpg/330px-Seal_of_the_Moderns_Grand_Lodge.jpg","width":320,"height":366},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Seal_of_the_Moderns_Grand_Lodge.jpg","width":556,"height":636},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1296119915","tid":"98113e0f-4bd1-11f0-856d-856a4508a51a","timestamp":"2025-06-17T23:20:02Z","description":"Masonic Grand Lodge in London, England (1717-1813)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Grand_Lodge_of_England","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Grand_Lodge_of_England?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Grand_Lodge_of_England?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Premier_Grand_Lodge_of_England"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Grand_Lodge_of_England","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Premier_Grand_Lodge_of_England","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Grand_Lodge_of_England?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Premier_Grand_Lodge_of_England"}},"extract":"The organisation now known as the Premier Grand Lodge of England was founded on 24 June 1717 as the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster.
