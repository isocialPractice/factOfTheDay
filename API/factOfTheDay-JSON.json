During the massacre, Myanmar Army troops and Myanmar Police Force officers killed at least sixty-five individuals. The massacre became one of the deadliest domestic incidents to occur in the aftermath of the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état, and marked a serious escalation in the military's violence against civilians resisting the coup. The violent crackdown also precipitated a mass exodus of factory workers, residents, and businesses from Hlaingthaya, a major factory hub in the country.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Hlaingthaya massacre"},{"type":"standard","title":"Yangon","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Yangon</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q37995","titles":{"canonical":"Yangon","normalized":"Yangon","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Yangon</span>"},"pageid":57404,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/ShwedagonPagoda.jpg/320px-ShwedagonPagoda.jpg","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/ShwedagonPagoda.jpg","width":800,"height":533},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1213441763","tid":"657cc89d-e0e1-11ee-99ef-3169ffbb23a5","timestamp":"2024-03-13T02:28:37Z","description":"Largest city of Myanmar (Burma)","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":16.795,"lon":96.16},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yangon"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Yangon","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yangon"}},"extract":"Yangon, formerly romanized as Rangoon, is the capital of the Yangon Region and the largest city of Myanmar.

While the war was officially fought between North Vietnam and South Vietnam, the north was supported by the Soviet Union, China, and other communist states, while the south was supported by the United States and other anti-communist allies, making the war a proxy war between the United States and the Soviet Union. It lasted almost 20 years, with direct U.S. military involvement ending in 1973. The conflict also spilled over into neighboring states, exacerbating the Laotian Civil War and the Cambodian Civil War, which ended with all three countries officially becoming communist states by 1976.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Vietnam War"},{"type":"standard","title":"North_Vietnam","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">North Vietnam</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q172640","titles":{"canonical":"North_Vietnam","normalized":"North Vietnam","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">North Vietnam</span>"},"pageid":23550210,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Flag_of_North_Vietnam_%281955%E2%80%931976%29.svg/320px-Flag_of_North_Vietnam_%281955%E2%80%931976%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Flag_of_North_Vietnam_%281955%E2%80%931976%29.svg/512px-Flag_of_North_Vietnam_%281955%E2%80%931976%29.svg.png","width":512,"height":341},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1212702255","tid":"c5b5f6bd-ddd1-11ee-b5df-7e280b935658","timestamp":"2024-03-09T04:59:13Z","description":"Former country in Southeast Asia that existed from 1945 to 1976","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":21.02833333,"lon":105.85416667},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:North_Vietnam"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/North_Vietnam","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:North_Vietnam"}},"extract":"North Vietnam, officially the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, was a socialist state in Southeast Asia that existed from 1945 to 1976, with formal sovereignty being fully recognized in 1954.

Eid al-Fitr falls on the first day of Shawwal in the Islamic calendar; this does not always fall on the same Gregorian day, as the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based on when the new moon is sighted by local religious authorities. The holiday is known under various other names in different languages and countries around the world. The day is also called Lesser Eid, or simply Eid.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Eid al-Fitr"},{"type":"standard","title":"Granada","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Granada</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q8810","titles":{"canonical":"Granada","normalized":"Granada","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Granada</span>"},"pageid":38264,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Granada_%2825987961022%29.jpg/320px-Granada_%2825987961022%29.jpg","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Granada_%2825987961022%29.jpg","width":4608,"height":3456},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1212510800","tid":"8b8722b8-dd15-11ee-a685-404f5300d023","timestamp":"2024-03-08T06:31:50Z","description":"Municipality in Andalusia, Spain","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":37.17805556,"lon":-3.60083333},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Granada"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Granada","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Granada"}},"extract":"Granada is the capital city of the province of Granada, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain.
