World War II is the deadliest conflict in history, causing the death of 70 to 85 million people, more than half of whom were civilians. Millions died in genocides, including the Holocaust, and by massacres, starvation, and disease. After the Allied victory, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea were occupied, and German and Japanese leaders were put on trial for war crimes.</p>","normalizedtitle":"World War II"},{"type":"standard","title":"Luftwaffe","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Luftwaffe</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2564009","titles":{"canonical":"Luftwaffe","normalized":"Luftwaffe","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Luftwaffe</span>"},"pageid":17885,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/COA_Luftwaffe_eagle_silver_%28looking_left%29.svg/330px-COA_Luftwaffe_eagle_silver_%28looking_left%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":188},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/COA_Luftwaffe_eagle_silver_%28looking_left%29.svg/512px-COA_Luftwaffe_eagle_silver_%28looking_left%29.svg.png","width":512,"height":301},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1321002542","tid":"cd7efd0c-bc42-11f0-95f4-8fb8a0045099","timestamp":"2025-11-08T01:32:35Z","description":"Branch of the German military during World War II","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Luftwaffe"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Luftwaffe","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Luftwaffe"}},"extract":"The Luftwaffe was the aerial-warfare branch of the Wehrmacht before and during World War II.

On 2 December 1942, the first human-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was initiated in CP-1 during an experiment led by Enrico Fermi. The secret development of the reactor was the first major technical achievement for the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to create nuclear weapons during World War II. Developed by the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, CP-1 was built under the west viewing stands of the original Stagg Field. Although the project's civilian and military leaders had misgivings about the possibility of a disastrous runaway reaction, they trusted Fermi's safety calculations and decided they could carry out the experiment in a densely populated area.
