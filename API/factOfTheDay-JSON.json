The rebellion was in response to Castile's policy of relocating Muslim populations from these regions and was partially instigated by Muhammad I of Granada. The rebels were aided by the independent Emirate of Granada, while the Castilians were allied with Aragon. Early in the uprising, the rebels managed to capture Murcia and Jerez, as well as several smaller towns, but were eventually defeated by the royal forces. Subsequently, Castile expelled the Muslim populations of the reconquered territories and encouraged Christians from elsewhere to settle their lands. Granada became a vassal of Castile and paid an annual tribute.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Mudéjar revolt of 1264–1266"},{"type":"standard","title":"James_I_of_Aragon","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">James I of Aragon</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q212052","titles":{"canonical":"James_I_of_Aragon","normalized":"James I of Aragon","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">James I of Aragon</span>"},"pageid":63332,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Jaime_I_de_Arag%C3%B3n.jpg","width":162,"height":353},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Jaime_I_de_Arag%C3%B3n.jpg","width":162,"height":353},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1267286944","tid":"ed2f33d1-ca95-11ef-92b2-d9096dbc6169","timestamp":"2025-01-04T12:17:55Z","description":"King of Aragon from 1213 to 1276","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_Aragon","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_Aragon?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_Aragon?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:James_I_of_Aragon"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_Aragon","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/James_I_of_Aragon","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_Aragon?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:James_I_of_Aragon"}},"extract":"James I the Conqueror was King of Aragon, Count of Barcelona, and Lord of Montpellier from 1213 to 1276; King of Majorca from 1231 to 1276; and King of Valencia from 1238 to 1276.
