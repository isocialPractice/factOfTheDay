Crimes currently punishable by death in Bangladesh are set out in the Penal Code 1860. These include waging war against the state, abetting mutiny, giving false evidence upon which an innocent person suffers death, murder, assisted suicide of a child, attempted murder of a child, and kidnapping. The <i>Code of Criminal Procedure</i> 1898 provides that a person given the death penalty \"be hanged by the neck until he is dead.\" For murder cases, the Appellate Division requires trial courts to weigh aggravating and mitigating factors to determine whether the death penalty is warranted.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Capital punishment in Bangladesh"}],"story":"<!--Nov 17-->Former prime minister of Bangladesh <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Sheikh_Hasina\" title=\"Sheikh Hasina\" id=\"mwBg\">Sheikh Hasina</a> <i id=\"mwBw\">(pictured)</i> is <b id=\"mwCA\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Trial_of_Sheikh_Hasina\" title=\"Trial of Sheikh Hasina\" id=\"mwCQ\">found guilty of crimes against humanity</a></b> in absentia by <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./International_Crimes_Tribunal_(Bangladesh)\" title=\"International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)\" id=\"mwCg\">a Bangladeshi court</a> and <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Capital_punishment_in_Bangladesh\" title=\"Capital punishment in Bangladesh\" id=\"mwCw\">sentenced to death</a>."},{"links":[{"type":"standard","title":"Mariana_dam_disaster","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mariana dam disaster</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q21402069","titles":{"canonical":"Mariana_dam_disaster","normalized":"Mariana dam disaster","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mariana dam disaster</span>"},"pageid":48475234,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Bento_Rodrigues%2C_Mariana%2C_Minas_Gerais_%2822828956680%29.jpg/330px-Bento_Rodrigues%2C_Mariana%2C_Minas_Gerais_%2822828956680%29.jpg","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Bento_Rodrigues%2C_Mariana%2C_Minas_Gerais_%2822828956680%29.jpg","width":1080,"height":720},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1322346586","tid":"6de1abba-c255-11f0-ac83-f31b9c7e469d","timestamp":"2025-11-15T19:01:02Z","description":"2015 environmental disaster near Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":-20.23138889,"lon":-43.4425},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_dam_disaster","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_dam_disaster?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_dam_disaster?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mariana_dam_disaster"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_dam_disaster","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Mariana_dam_disaster","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_dam_disaster?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mariana_dam_disaster"}},"extract":"The Mariana dam disaster, also known as the Bento Rodrigues or Samarco dam disaster, occurred on 5 November 2015, when the Fundão tailings dam at the Germano iron ore mine of the Samarco Mariana Mining Complex near Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil, suffered a catastrophic failure, resulting in flooding that devastated the downstream villages of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo, killing 19 people.
