Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the late 5th century, Constantinople remained the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Latin Empire (1204–1261), and the Ottoman Empire (1453–1922). Following the Turkish War of Independence, the Turkish capital then moved to Ankara. Officially renamed Istanbul in 1930, the city is today the largest city in Europe, straddling the Bosporus strait and lying in both Europe and Asia, and the financial centre of Turkey.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Constantinople"},{"type":"standard","title":"Cross-in-square","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Cross-in-square</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1788398","titles":{"canonical":"Cross-in-square","normalized":"Cross-in-square","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Cross-in-square</span>"},"pageid":12593205,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Panagia_Chalkeon_2.jpg/320px-Panagia_Chalkeon_2.jpg","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Panagia_Chalkeon_2.jpg","width":1280,"height":960},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1206499686","tid":"fd727c60-c986-11ee-b67a-f9b8dbadc264","timestamp":"2024-02-12T09:13:31Z","description":"Architectural form of middle- and late-period Byzantine churches","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-in-square","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-in-square?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-in-square?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cross-in-square"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-in-square","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Cross-in-square","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-in-square?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cross-in-square"}},"extract":"A cross-in-square or crossed-dome plan was the dominant architectural form of middle- and late-period Byzantine churches.
