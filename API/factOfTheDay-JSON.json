Snow fell from 10 to 58 inches in parts of New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and sustained winds of more than 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) produced snowdrifts in excess of 50 feet (15 m).

A bill does not become law until it is passed by the legislature and has been, in most cases, approved by the executive. Once a bill has been enacted into law by the legislature, it is called an <i>act of the legislature</i>, or a <i>statute</i>. Bills are introduced in the legislature and are discussed, debated and voted upon.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Bill (law)"},{"type":"standard","title":"Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Parliament of the United Kingdom</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q11010","titles":{"canonical":"Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","normalized":"Parliament of the United Kingdom","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Parliament of the United Kingdom</span>"},"pageid":13964,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/House_of_Lords_composition.svg/320px-House_of_Lords_composition.svg.png","width":320,"height":219},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/House_of_Lords_composition.svg/360px-House_of_Lords_composition.svg.png","width":360,"height":246},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1212589006","tid":"5a85fac3-dd6c-11ee-a9dc-bf6b936e45d9","timestamp":"2024-03-08T16:53:14Z","description":"Legislative body in the United Kingdom","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":51.49944444,"lon":-0.12472222},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom"}},"extract":"The Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the supreme legislative body of the United Kingdom, and may also legislate for the Crown Dependencies and the British Overseas Territories.
