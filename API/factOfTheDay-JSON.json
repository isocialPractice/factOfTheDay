Subsequent albums <i>Vol. 4</i> (1972), <i>Sabbath Bloody Sabbath</i> (1973), <i>Sabotage</i> (1975), <i>Technical Ecstasy</i> (1976), and <i>Never Say Die!</i> (1978) saw the band explore more experimental and progressive styles.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Black Sabbath"},{"views":104658,"rank":28,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-07-03Z","views":141},{"date":"2025-07-04Z","views":30896},{"date":"2025-07-05Z","views":113575},{"date":"2025-07-06Z","views":119182},{"date":"2025-07-07Z","views":104658}],"type":"standard","title":"Guadalupe_River_(Texas)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Guadalupe River (Texas)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1552614","titles":{"canonical":"Guadalupe_River_(Texas)","normalized":"Guadalupe River (Texas)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Guadalupe River (Texas)</span>"},"pageid":1484086,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Guadalupe_river_state_park_bluff.jpg/330px-Guadalupe_river_state_park_bluff.jpg","width":320,"height":197},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Guadalupe_river_state_park_bluff.jpg","width":1785,"height":1097},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1299347023","tid":"ef74555d-5b7a-11f0-ac31-4cf64c0606b9","timestamp":"2025-07-07T21:40:01Z","description":"River in Texas, United States","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":28.40194444,"lon":-96.7825},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalupe_River_(Texas)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalupe_River_(Texas)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalupe_River_(Texas)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Guadalupe_River_(Texas)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalupe_River_(Texas)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Guadalupe_River_(Texas)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalupe_River_(Texas)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Guadalupe_River_(Texas)"}},"extract":"The Guadalupe River runs from Kerr County, Texas, to San Antonio Bay on the Gulf Coast.

The main events took place in Rangoon, Burma, from 7 to 8 July 1962. On 7 July the military regime violently suppressed a student demonstration at Rangoon University attended by some 5,000 students. This resulted in the deaths of more than one hundred, and the arrest of more than 6,000 students according to unofficial sources. However, official government statements put the death toll at 15. In the morning hours of the next day, the military regime blew up the historic Rangoon University Students' Union (RUSU) building, which had been the symbol of the anti-colonial nationalism struggle since the 1920s.</p>","normalizedtitle":"1962 Rangoon University protests"},{"type":"standard","title":"University_of_Yangon","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">University of Yangon</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1185947","titles":{"canonical":"University_of_Yangon","normalized":"University of Yangon","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">University of Yangon</span>"},"pageid":2242248,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0d/Seal_of_the_University_of_Yangon.png","width":209,"height":241},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0d/Seal_of_the_University_of_Yangon.png","width":209,"height":241},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1294923739","tid":"b34fdd8e-4618-11f0-8e24-861952a99978","timestamp":"2025-06-10T16:33:55Z","description":"Public university in Myanmar","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":16.83,"lon":96.135},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Yangon","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Yangon?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Yangon?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:University_of_Yangon"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Yangon","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/University_of_Yangon","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Yangon?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:University_of_Yangon"}},"extract":"The University of Yangon, located in Kamayut, Yangon, is the oldest university in Myanmar's modern education system and the best known university in Myanmar.
