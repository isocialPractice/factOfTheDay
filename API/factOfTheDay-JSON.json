The programme was inspired by <i>The Twilight Zone</i> and explores technology and its side-effects. It began on the British television network Channel 4 before moving to the American streaming platform Netflix and has run for seven series between 2011 and 2025. There are 33 episodes and one interactive film, <i>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</i>. Episodes vary in length between 40 and 89 minutes and can be watched in any order. Actors rarely appear in more than one episode, though many instalments make small references known as \"Easter eggs\" to previous episodes, such as through in-universe news channels and briefly-seen text. In 2025, the episode \"USS Callister\" received a sequel episode titled \"USS Callister: Into Infinity\", marking it as the first <i>Black Mirror</i> story to receive a continuation.</p>","normalizedtitle":"List of Black Mirror episodes"},{"views":134076,"rank":12,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-04-07Z","views":140868},{"date":"2025-04-08Z","views":135048},{"date":"2025-04-09Z","views":132409},{"date":"2025-04-10Z","views":130130},{"date":"2025-04-11Z","views":134076}],"type":"standard","title":"Deaths_in_2025","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Deaths in 2025</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q131381961","titles":{"canonical":"Deaths_in_2025","normalized":"Deaths in 2025","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Deaths in 2025</span>"},"pageid":75715266,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1285178395","tid":"5ab3bb59-1751-11f0-b68d-fce2df057a06","timestamp":"2025-04-12T03:51:03Z","description":"","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2025","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2025?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2025?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Deaths_in_2025"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2025","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Deaths_in_2025","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2025?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Deaths_in_2025"}},"extract":"\n\n\n\nThe following notable deaths occurred in 2025.
