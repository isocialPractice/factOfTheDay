The song has been called \"a declaration\" and \"the beginning of the civil rights movement\".</p>","normalizedtitle":"Strange Fruit"},{"type":"standard","title":"Civil_rights_movement_(1896–1954)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Civil rights movement (1896–1954)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q10579095","titles":{"canonical":"Civil_rights_movement_(1896–1954)","normalized":"Civil rights movement (1896–1954)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Civil rights movement (1896–1954)</span>"},"pageid":1688046,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1206713685","tid":"4400cf24-c9f9-11ee-8276-fd3b2c21091b","timestamp":"2024-02-12T22:51:32Z","description":"Social movement in the United States","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement_(1896%E2%80%931954)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement_(1896%E2%80%931954)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement_(1896%E2%80%931954)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Civil_rights_movement_(1896%E2%80%931954)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement_(1896%E2%80%931954)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Civil_rights_movement_(1896%E2%80%931954)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement_(1896%E2%80%931954)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Civil_rights_movement_(1896%E2%80%931954)"}},"extract":"The civil rights movement (1896–1954) was a long, primarily nonviolent action to bring full civil rights and equality under the law to all Americans.
