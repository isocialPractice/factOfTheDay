A radioactive metal, lawrencium is the eleventh transuranium element, the third transfermium, and the last member of the actinide series. Like all elements with atomic number over 100, lawrencium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. Fourteen isotopes of lawrencium are currently known; the most stable is <sup>266</sup>Lr with half-life 11 hours, but the shorter-lived <sup>260</sup>Lr is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Lawrencium"},{"type":"standard","title":"Synthetic_element","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Synthetic element</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q755992","titles":{"canonical":"Synthetic_element","normalized":"Synthetic element","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Synthetic element</span>"},"pageid":29365,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Redgreen_colorblind_changed_version_of_Synthetic_Mod.png/320px-Redgreen_colorblind_changed_version_of_Synthetic_Mod.png","width":320,"height":218},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Redgreen_colorblind_changed_version_of_Synthetic_Mod.png","width":1200,"height":816},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1245101642","tid":"49e365b4-6fd9-11ef-ae61-9a66100a8ee5","timestamp":"2024-09-11T01:00:51Z","description":"Chemical elements that do not occur naturally","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_element","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_element?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_element?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Synthetic_element"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_element","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Synthetic_element","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_element?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Synthetic_element"}},"extract":"A synthetic element is one of 24 known chemical elements that do not occur naturally on Earth: they have been created by human manipulation of fundamental particles in a nuclear reactor, a particle accelerator, or the explosion of an atomic bomb; thus, they are called \"synthetic\", \"artificial\", or \"man-made\".
