A revolt led by William Marshal's son Richard broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Henry III of England"},{"type":"standard","title":"Battle_of_Lewes","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Battle of Lewes</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2164009","titles":{"canonical":"Battle_of_Lewes","normalized":"Battle of Lewes","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Battle of Lewes</span>"},"pageid":49582,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Lewes.jpg/320px-Lewes.jpg","width":320,"height":252},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Lewes.jpg","width":747,"height":589},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1223755427","tid":"c68a5a10-11a5-11ef-ade9-c417a95f7510","timestamp":"2024-05-14T03:55:17Z","description":"1264 battle of the Second Barons' War","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":50.87861111,"lon":-0.01388889},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lewes","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lewes?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lewes?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Lewes"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lewes","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Battle_of_Lewes","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lewes?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Lewes"}},"extract":"The Battle of Lewes was one of two main battles of the conflict known as the Second Barons' War.
