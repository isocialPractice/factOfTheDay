Headquartered in Washington, D.C., NASA operates ten field centers across the United States and is organized into mission directorates for Science, Space Operations, Exploration Systems Development, Space Technology, Aeronautics Research, and Mission Support. Established in 1958, NASA succeeded the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to give the American space development effort a distinct civilian orientation, emphasizing peaceful applications in space science. It has since led most of America's space exploration programs, including Project Mercury, Project Gemini, the 1968–1972 Apollo program missions, the Skylab space station, and the Space Shuttle.</p>","normalizedtitle":"NASA"},{"type":"standard","title":"Apollo_Lunar_Module","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Apollo Lunar Module</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q208382","titles":{"canonical":"Apollo_Lunar_Module","normalized":"Apollo Lunar Module","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Apollo Lunar Module</span>"},"pageid":151932,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Apollo_14_Lunar_Module_%28LM%29_on_the_moon.jpg/330px-Apollo_14_Lunar_Module_%28LM%29_on_the_moon.jpg","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Apollo_14_Lunar_Module_%28LM%29_on_the_moon.jpg","width":3892,"height":3892},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1331108168","tid":"f1ca323f-e984-11f0-ab86-ca894ad12c0c","timestamp":"2026-01-04T15:49:25Z","description":"NASA crewed Moon landing spacecraft (1969–1972)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Apollo_Lunar_Module"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Apollo_Lunar_Module","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Apollo_Lunar_Module"}},"extract":"The Apollo Lunar Module, originally designated the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM), was the lunar lander spacecraft that was flown between lunar orbit and the Moon's surface during the United States' Apollo program.
