The oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed on 14 June 1775 to fight the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783)—against the British for independence before the United States was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself a continuation of the Continental Army, and thus considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775.</p>","normalizedtitle":"United States Army"},{"type":"standard","title":"Lakota_people","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Lakota people</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q333049","titles":{"canonical":"Lakota_people","normalized":"Lakota people","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Lakota people</span>"},"pageid":56124,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/En-chief-sitting-bull.jpg","width":200,"height":300},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/En-chief-sitting-bull.jpg","width":200,"height":300},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1188107023","tid":"217a2b60-91ca-11ee-bd7b-9746060cf9f1","timestamp":"2023-12-03T10:52:59Z","description":"Indigenous people of the Great Plains","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lakota_people"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Lakota_people","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lakota_people"}},"extract":"The Lakota are a Native American people.
