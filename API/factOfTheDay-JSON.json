China under the Qianlong Emperor launched four invasions of Burma between 1765 and 1769, which were considered one of his Ten Great Campaigns. Nonetheless, the war, which claimed the lives of over 70,000 Chinese soldiers and four commanders, is sometimes described as \"the most disastrous frontier war that the Qing dynasty had ever waged\", and one that \"assured Burmese independence\".
