Once a bowler has bowled an over, a teammate will bowl an over from the other end of the pitch. The Laws of Cricket govern how a ball must be bowled. If a ball is bowled illegally, an umpire will rule it a <i>no-ball</i>. If a ball is bowled too wide of the striker for the batsman to be able to play at it with a proper cricket shot, the bowler's end umpire will rule it a <i>wide</i>.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Bowling (cricket)"},{"type":"standard","title":"List_of_Test_cricket_hat-tricks","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">List of Test cricket hat-tricks</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q13644267","titles":{"canonical":"List_of_Test_cricket_hat-tricks","normalized":"List of Test cricket hat-tricks","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">List of Test cricket hat-tricks</span>"},"pageid":1024039,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Stuart_Broad3.JPG/320px-Stuart_Broad3.JPG","width":320,"height":388},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Stuart_Broad3.JPG","width":1546,"height":1875},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1271934147","tid":"e9478d54-dbd7-11ef-ae2b-1cb30b20c738","timestamp":"2025-01-26T11:23:05Z","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Test_cricket_hat-tricks","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Test_cricket_hat-tricks?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Test_cricket_hat-tricks?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_Test_cricket_hat-tricks"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Test_cricket_hat-tricks","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/List_of_Test_cricket_hat-tricks","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Test_cricket_hat-tricks?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_Test_cricket_hat-tricks"}},"extract":"In cricket, a hat-trick occurs when a bowler takes a wicket with each of three consecutive deliveries.
