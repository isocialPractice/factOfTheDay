It is mainly within the London Borough of Lambeth, running along the boundary with the London Borough of Southwark, a boundary which can be discerned from the early medieval period between the Lambeth and St George's parishes of those boroughs respectively. It is located 1.4 miles (2.3 km) south of Charing Cross in Inner London and is identified as a local centre in the London Plan. It was a royal manor in the parish of St Mary, Lambeth in the county of Surrey and was the administrative centre of the parish from 1853. Proximity to central London was key to the development of the area as a residential suburb and it was incorporated into the metropolitan area of London in 1855.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Kennington"}],"year":1872},{"text":"The Bank for Savings in the City of New-York, the first savings bank in New York City, was incorporated.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Bank_for_Savings_in_the_City_of_New-York","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Bank for Savings in the City of New-York</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q56063177","titles":{"canonical":"Bank_for_Savings_in_the_City_of_New-York","normalized":"Bank for Savings in the City of New-York","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Bank for Savings in the City of New-York</span>"},"pageid":56897176,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1213775272","tid":"97bc22c2-e26f-11ee-ab32-42218c2d97b2","timestamp":"2024-03-15T01:59:01Z","description":"First savings bank in New York City (1819–1982)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_Savings_in_the_City_of_New-York","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_Savings_in_the_City_of_New-York?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_Savings_in_the_City_of_New-York?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bank_for_Savings_in_the_City_of_New-York"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_Savings_in_the_City_of_New-York","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Bank_for_Savings_in_the_City_of_New-York","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_Savings_in_the_City_of_New-York?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bank_for_Savings_in_the_City_of_New-York"}},"extract":"The Bank for Savings in the City of New-York (1819–1982) was one of the earliest banks in the United States and the first savings bank in New York City.
