Unlike large, costly minicomputers and mainframes, time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers. The term home computer has also been used, primarily in the late 1970s and 1980s.

Theosophical texts posit that the purpose of this Office is to facilitate the transfer of knowledge about the true constitution and workings of Existence to humankind. Humanity is thereby assisted on its presumed cyclical but ever-progressive evolutionary path. Reputedly, one way the knowledge transfer is accomplished is by Maitreya occasionally manifesting or incarnating in the physical realm; the manifested entity then assumes the role of <em>World Teacher of Humankind</em>.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Maitreya (Theosophy)"},{"type":"standard","title":"Order_of_the_Star_in_the_East","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Order of the Star in the East</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1725321","titles":{"canonical":"Order_of_the_Star_in_the_East","normalized":"Order of the Star in the East","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Order of the Star in the East</span>"},"pageid":7952735,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1302692521","tid":"e55eb839-6a81-11f0-809c-e4cc2583ba1b","timestamp":"2025-07-27T00:37:38Z","description":"Spiritual organization based in India (1911–1927)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Star_in_the_East","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Star_in_the_East?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Star_in_the_East?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Order_of_the_Star_in_the_East"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Star_in_the_East","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Order_of_the_Star_in_the_East","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Star_in_the_East?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Order_of_the_Star_in_the_East"}},"extract":"The Order of the Star in the East (OSE) was an international organization based at Benares (Varanasi), India from 1911 to 1927.
