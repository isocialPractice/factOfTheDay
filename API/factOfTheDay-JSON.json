As no candidate won a majority in the first round, a runoff was held, in which Emmanuel Macron defeated Marine Le Pen and was re-elected as President of France. Macron, from La République En Marche! (LREM), had defeated Le Pen, leader of the National Rally, once already in the 2017 French presidential election, for the term which expired on 13 May 2022. Macron became the first president of France to win a re-election bid since Jacques Chirac won in 2002.</p>","normalizedtitle":"2022 French presidential election"}],"story":"<!--Mar 31--><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Marine_Le_Pen\" title=\"Marine Le Pen\" id=\"mwEg\">Marine Le Pen</a>, the runner-up in <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./2017_French_presidential_election\" title=\"2017 French presidential election\" id=\"mwEw\">the 2017</a> and <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./2022_French_presidential_election\" title=\"2022 French presidential election\" id=\"mwFA\">2022 French presidential elections</a>, <b id=\"mwFQ\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./National_Front_assistants_affair\" title=\"National Front assistants affair\" id=\"mwFg\">is convicted</a></b> of embezzlement and banned from standing in elections for five years."},{"links":[{"type":"standard","title":"2025_Myanmar_earthquake","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">2025 Myanmar earthquake</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q133574091","titles":{"canonical":"2025_Myanmar_earthquake","normalized":"2025 Myanmar earthquake","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">2025 Myanmar earthquake</span>"},"pageid":79572648,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/2025_Myanmar_earthquake_damage_in_Mandalay_%282%29.png/330px-2025_Myanmar_earthquake_damage_in_Mandalay_%282%29.png","width":320,"height":180},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/2025_Myanmar_earthquake_damage_in_Mandalay_%282%29.png","width":1920,"height":1080},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1284370675","tid":"169875b9-136b-11f0-b650-cb5fd0dfac83","timestamp":"2025-04-07T04:45:11Z","description":"Earthquake in Southeast Asia","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":21.996,"lon":95.926},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2025_Myanmar_earthquake"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/2025_Myanmar_earthquake","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2025_Myanmar_earthquake"}},"extract":"On 28 March 2025 at 12:50:52 MMT, a Mw 7.7 earthquake struck the Sagaing Region of Myanmar, with an epicenter close to Mandalay, the country's second-largest city.
