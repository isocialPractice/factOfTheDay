The tomb, also known by its tomb number <b>Wadi C-4</b>, was identified through a joint Egyptian-British archaeological expedition. The tomb is linked to Thutmose II, a pharaoh of the 16th–15th centuries BC. The tomb lacks Thutmose's mummy which was found in 1881 in the Royal Cache. It is the first royal tomb from the New Kingdom or Egyptian Empire Period uncovered since Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Tomb of Thutmose II"},{"type":"standard","title":"Luxor","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Luxor</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q130514","titles":{"canonical":"Luxor","normalized":"Luxor","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Luxor</span>"},"pageid":177097,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Luxor_11.jpg/320px-Luxor_11.jpg","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Luxor_11.jpg","width":4358,"height":3269},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1277156564","tid":"d26870fd-f17e-11ef-82da-af1d7649b600","timestamp":"2025-02-23T00:40:47Z","description":"City in southern Egypt","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":25.69666667,"lon":32.64444444},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Luxor"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Luxor","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Luxor"}},"extract":"Luxor is a city in Upper Egypt, which includes the site of the Ancient Egyptian city of Thebes.
