The court hears the case of Karen Andre, a former secretary and lover of businessman Bjorn Faulkner, of whose murder she is accused. The play does not directly portray the events leading to Faulkner's death; instead the jury must rely on character testimony to decide whether Andre is guilty.

It was established as the <i>de facto</i> championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the <i>de jure</i> NHL championship prize in 1947.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Stanley Cup"},{"type":"standard","title":"Dawson_City_Nuggets","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Dawson City Nuggets</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3346094","titles":{"canonical":"Dawson_City_Nuggets","normalized":"Dawson City Nuggets","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Dawson City Nuggets</span>"},"pageid":3204101,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Dawson_City_Nuggets.png/320px-Dawson_City_Nuggets.png","width":320,"height":282},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Dawson_City_Nuggets.png","width":630,"height":556},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1248698373","tid":"9989cfa3-7f88-11ef-a1f8-b9e4f084c9bf","timestamp":"2024-10-01T00:03:34Z","description":"Historic ice hockey team in Yukon, Canada","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson_City_Nuggets","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson_City_Nuggets?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson_City_Nuggets?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dawson_City_Nuggets"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson_City_Nuggets","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Dawson_City_Nuggets","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson_City_Nuggets?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dawson_City_Nuggets"}},"extract":"The Dawson City Nuggets were an ice hockey team from Dawson City, Yukon, that challenged the reigning champion Ottawa Hockey Club, aka \"the Silver Seven\", in January 1905, for the Stanley Cup.

Under the direction of King Henry VIII of England, the Reformation Parliament was the first in English history to deal with major religious legislation, much of it orchestrated by, among others, the Boleyn family and Thomas Cromwell. This legislation transferred many aspects of English life away from the control of the Catholic Church to control under The Crown. This action both set a precedent for future monarchs to utilize parliamentary statutes affecting the Church of England; strengthened the role of the English Parliament; and provided a significant transference of wealth from the Catholic Church to the English Crown.</p>","normalizedtitle":"English Reformation Parliament"}],"year":1537},{"text":"Eleanor of Provence received permission from her son King Edward I of England to expel Jews from the towns of Worcester, Marlborough, Cambridge and Gloucester.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Eleanor_of_Provence","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Eleanor of Provence</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q228885","titles":{"canonical":"Eleanor_of_Provence","normalized":"Eleanor of Provence","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Eleanor of Provence</span>"},"pageid":228551,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Eleonor_Provence.jpg","width":200,"height":298},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Eleonor_Provence.jpg","width":200,"height":298},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1269499167","tid":"48eb9328-d2d6-11ef-a04b-2d5df37322dc","timestamp":"2025-01-15T00:18:46Z","description":"Queen of England from 1236 to 1272","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Provence","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Provence?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Provence?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Eleanor_of_Provence"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Provence","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Eleanor_of_Provence","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Provence?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Eleanor_of_Provence"}},"extract":"Eleanor of Provence was a Provençal noblewoman who became Queen of England as the wife of King Henry III from 1236 until his death in 1272.

As a title, princeps originated in the Roman Republic wherein the leading member of the Senate was designated princeps senatus. It is primarily associated with the Roman emperors as an unofficial title first adopted by Augustus in 23 BC. Its use in this context continued until the regime of Diocletian at the end of the third century. He preferred the title of dominus, meaning \"lord\" or \"master\". As a result, the Roman Empire from Augustus to Diocletian is termed the \"principate\" (principatus).
