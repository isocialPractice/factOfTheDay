Concorde's last commercial flight was in October 2003, with a November 26, 2003, ferry flight being its last flight.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Supersonic transport"}],"year":1976},{"text":"Tripura, formerly part of the independent Twipra Kingdom, became a state of India.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Tripura","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Tripura</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1363","titles":{"canonical":"Tripura","normalized":"Tripura","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Tripura</span>"},"pageid":319196,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Tripura_State_Museum_Agartala_Tripura_India.jpg/330px-Tripura_State_Museum_Agartala_Tripura_India.jpg","width":320,"height":169},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Tripura_State_Museum_Agartala_Tripura_India.jpg","width":5999,"height":3162},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1333526920","tid":"99e2ffe6-f44b-11f0-8cde-c3a6e1fcea46","timestamp":"2026-01-18T08:56:39Z","description":"State in northeastern India","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":23.84,"lon":91.28},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tripura"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Tripura","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tripura"}},"extract":"Tripura is a state in northeastern India.
