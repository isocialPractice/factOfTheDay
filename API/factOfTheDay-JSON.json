Originally known as the <i>Cappella Magna</i>, it takes its name from Pope Sixtus IV, who had it built between 1473 and 1481. Since that time, it has served as a place of both religious and functionary papal activity. Today, it is the site of the papal conclave, the process by which a new pope is selected. The chapel's fame lies mainly in the frescoes that decorate its interior, most particularly the Sistine Chapel ceiling and <i>The Last Judgment</i>, both by Michelangelo.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Sistine Chapel"},{"type":"standard","title":"Pope_Alexander_VI","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pope Alexander VI</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q108316","titles":{"canonical":"Pope_Alexander_VI","normalized":"Pope Alexander VI","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pope Alexander VI</span>"},"pageid":23791,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Portrait_of_Pope_Alexander_VI_Borgia_%28Vatican_Museums_-_Musei_Vaticani%2C_Vatican%29.jpg/330px-Portrait_of_Pope_Alexander_VI_Borgia_%28Vatican_Museums_-_Musei_Vaticani%2C_Vatican%29.jpg","width":320,"height":447},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Portrait_of_Pope_Alexander_VI_Borgia_%28Vatican_Museums_-_Musei_Vaticani%2C_Vatican%29.jpg","width":3005,"height":4202},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1303311812","tid":"13a5f956-6d11-11f0-bbba-2e2a6db94566","timestamp":"2025-07-30T06:47:36Z","description":"Bishop of Rome from 1492 to 1503","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pope_Alexander_VI"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Pope_Alexander_VI","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pope_Alexander_VI"}},"extract":"Pope Alexander VI was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 11 August 1492 until his death in 1503.","extract_html":"<p><b>Pope Alexander VI</b> was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 11 August 1492 until his death in 1503.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Pope Alexander VI"},{"type":"standard","title":"Pope_Innocent_VIII","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pope Innocent VIII</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q161351","titles":{"canonical":"Pope_Innocent_VIII","normalized":"Pope Innocent VIII","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pope Innocent VIII</span>"},"pageid":24643,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Niccol%C3%B2_di_forzore_spinelli%2C_medaglia_di_innocenzo_viii_01.JPG/330px-Niccol%C3%B2_di_forzore_spinelli%2C_medaglia_di_innocenzo_viii_01.JPG","width":320,"height":321},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Niccol%C3%B2_di_forzore_spinelli%2C_medaglia_di_innocenzo_viii_01.JPG","width":1628,"height":1631},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1299174986","tid":"639cee05-5abe-11f0-91e6-5bb0220a68a5","timestamp":"2025-07-06T23:10:21Z","description":"Head of the Catholic Church from 1484 to 1492","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_VIII","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_VIII?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_VIII?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pope_Innocent_VIII"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_VIII","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Pope_Innocent_VIII","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_VIII?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pope_Innocent_VIII"}},"extract":"Pope Innocent VIII, born Giovanni Battista Cybo, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 29 August 1484 to his death, in July 1492.

Its territory consisted of what are now the regions of Oltenia, Transylvania and Banat. During Roman rule, it was organized as an imperial province on the borders of the empire. It is estimated that the population of Roman Dacia ranged from 650,000 to 1,200,000. It was conquered by Trajan (98–117) after two campaigns that devastated the Dacian Kingdom of Decebalus. However, the Romans did not occupy its entirety; Crișana, Maramureș, and most of Moldavia remained under the Free Dacians.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Roman Dacia"},{"type":"standard","title":"Roman_province","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Roman province</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q182547","titles":{"canonical":"Roman_province","normalized":"Roman province","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Roman province</span>"},"pageid":314732,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Roman_SPQR_banner.svg/320px-Roman_SPQR_banner.svg.png","width":320,"height":254},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Roman_SPQR_banner.svg/289px-Roman_SPQR_banner.svg.png","width":289,"height":229},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1305003514","tid":"6064a889-7523-11f0-b611-51b1f0313dd1","timestamp":"2025-08-09T13:18:45Z","description":"Ancient Roman administrative regions","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Roman_province"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Roman_province","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Roman_province"}},"extract":"The Roman provinces were the administrative regions of Ancient Rome outside Roman Italy that were controlled by the Romans under the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire.
