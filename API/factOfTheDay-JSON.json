Many participating countries invested all available economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities into this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. It was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70–85 million fatalities. Millions died due to genocides, including the Holocaust, as well as starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of Axis defeat, Germany, Austria, and Japan were occupied, and war crime tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.</p>","normalizedtitle":"World War II"},{"type":"standard","title":"Friesoythe","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Friesoythe</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q559637","titles":{"canonical":"Friesoythe","normalized":"Friesoythe","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Friesoythe</span>"},"pageid":4468838,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Friesoythe_Kirche.JPG/320px-Friesoythe_Kirche.JPG","width":320,"height":427},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Friesoythe_Kirche.JPG","width":3000,"height":4000},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1180965808","tid":"551e4df0-6edb-11ee-8beb-9ea200ba083d","timestamp":"2023-10-19T23:58:00Z","description":"Town in Cloppenburg, Lower Saxony, Germany","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":53.02055556,"lon":7.85861111},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friesoythe","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friesoythe?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friesoythe?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Friesoythe"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friesoythe","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Friesoythe","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friesoythe?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Friesoythe"}},"extract":"Friesoythe, in Saterland Frisian language Ait or Äit, is a town in the district of Cloppenburg, Lower Saxony, Germany, on the river Soeste, 25 kilometres (16 mi) northwest of Cloppenburg, and 30 kilometres (19 mi) southwest of Oldenburg.","extract_html":"<p><b>Friesoythe</b>, in Saterland Frisian language <b>Ait</b> or <b>Äit</b>, is a town in the district of Cloppenburg, Lower Saxony, Germany, on the river Soeste, 25 kilometres (16 mi) northwest of Cloppenburg, and 30 kilometres (19 mi) southwest of Oldenburg.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Friesoythe"},{"type":"standard","title":"Razing_of_Friesoythe","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Razing of Friesoythe</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q48815990","titles":{"canonical":"Razing_of_Friesoythe","normalized":"Razing of Friesoythe","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Razing of Friesoythe</span>"},"pageid":56416531,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Captured_German_flag%2C_Friesoythe%2C_Germany%2C_16_April_1945.jpg/320px-Captured_German_flag%2C_Friesoythe%2C_Germany%2C_16_April_1945.jpg","width":320,"height":314},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Captured_German_flag%2C_Friesoythe%2C_Germany%2C_16_April_1945.jpg","width":600,"height":589},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1215307716","tid":"2a24ab5b-e9c3-11ee-a8ad-fb020abc8c6f","timestamp":"2024-03-24T09:44:53Z","description":"World War II battle and war crime","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":53.02055556,"lon":7.85861111},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razing_of_Friesoythe","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razing_of_Friesoythe?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razing_of_Friesoythe?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Razing_of_Friesoythe"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razing_of_Friesoythe","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Razing_of_Friesoythe","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razing_of_Friesoythe?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Razing_of_Friesoythe"}},"extract":"The razing of Friesoythe was the destruction of the town of Friesoythe in Lower Saxony on 14 April 1945, during the Western Allies' invasion of Germany towards the end of World War II in Europe.
