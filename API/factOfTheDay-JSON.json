Article 5 of the treaty states that if an armed attack occurs against one of the member states, it shall be considered an attack against all members, and other members shall assist the attacked member, with armed forces if necessary. Article 6 of the treaty limits the scope of Article 5 to the islands north of the Tropic of Cancer, the North American and European mainlands, the entirety of Turkey, and French Algeria, the last of which has been moot since July 1962. Thus, an attack on Hawaii, Puerto Rico, French Guiana, the Falkland Islands, Ceuta or Melilla, among other places, would not trigger an Article 5 response.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Member states of NATO"},{"type":"standard","title":"NATO","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">NATO</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q7184","titles":{"canonical":"NATO","normalized":"NATO","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">NATO</span>"},"pageid":21133,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/NATO_OTAN_landscape_logo.svg/320px-NATO_OTAN_landscape_logo.svg.png","width":320,"height":160},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/NATO_OTAN_landscape_logo.svg/917px-NATO_OTAN_landscape_logo.svg.png","width":917,"height":459},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1213186403","tid":"193762aa-dfbb-11ee-8df1-98c499ce82b4","timestamp":"2024-03-11T15:21:57Z","description":"Intergovernmental military alliance","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:NATO"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/NATO","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:NATO"}},"extract":"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance of 32 member states – 30 European and two North American.
