In 2025, the episode \"<span>USS <i>Callister</i></span>\" received a sequel episode titled \"<span>USS <i>Callister</i>: Into Infinity</span>\", marking it as the first <i>Black Mirror</i> story to receive a continuation.</p>","normalizedtitle":"List of Black Mirror episodes"},{"views":87033,"rank":20,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-04-15Z","views":31156},{"date":"2025-04-16Z","views":45117},{"date":"2025-04-17Z","views":157181},{"date":"2025-04-18Z","views":466574},{"date":"2025-04-19Z","views":87033}],"type":"standard","title":"Good_Friday","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Good Friday</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q40317","titles":{"canonical":"Good_Friday","normalized":"Good Friday","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Good Friday</span>"},"pageid":58009,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Cristo_crucificado.jpg/330px-Cristo_crucificado.jpg","width":320,"height":477},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Cristo_crucificado.jpg","width":2046,"height":3051},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1286435342","tid":"47649cab-1d6a-11f0-9e49-eecdfff22a75","timestamp":"2025-04-19T22:04:35Z","description":"Christian holiday","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Good_Friday"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Good_Friday","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Good_Friday"}},"extract":"Good Friday, also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, Great and Holy Friday, or Friday of the Passion of the Lord, is a solemn Christian holy day commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus and his death at Calvary (Golgotha).

An English fleet under Admiral Robert Blake penetrated the heavily defended harbour at Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the Spanish Canary Islands and attacked their treasure fleet. The treasure had already been landed and was safe but the English engaged the harbour forts and the Spanish ships, many of which were scuttled and the remainder burnt. Having achieved his aim, Blake withdrew without losing any ships.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1657)"},{"type":"standard","title":"Canary_Islands","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Canary Islands</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q5813","titles":{"canonical":"Canary_Islands","normalized":"Canary Islands","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Canary Islands</span>"},"pageid":5717,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Flag_of_the_Canary_Islands.svg/330px-Flag_of_the_Canary_Islands.svg.png","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Flag_of_the_Canary_Islands.svg/600px-Flag_of_the_Canary_Islands.svg.png","width":600,"height":400},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1286302490","tid":"93a4da1e-1cbb-11f0-a617-4984ddb94f9b","timestamp":"2025-04-19T01:14:01Z","description":"Spanish archipelago and region in the Atlantic Ocean","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":28,"lon":-15.75},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Canary_Islands"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Canary_Islands","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Canary_Islands"}},"extract":"The Canary Islands, also known informally as The Canaries, are an archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean and the southernmost Autonomous Community of Spain.
