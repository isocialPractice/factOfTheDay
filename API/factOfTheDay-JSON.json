The blues form is ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll, and is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale, and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes, usually thirds, fifths or sevenths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Blues"},{"type":"standard","title":"Gospel_music","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Gospel music</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q180268","titles":{"canonical":"Gospel_music","normalized":"Gospel music","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Gospel music</span>"},"pageid":167391,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Dartmouth_Gospel_Choir_at_the_Gospel_Brunch_%283232282945%29.jpg/330px-Dartmouth_Gospel_Choir_at_the_Gospel_Brunch_%283232282945%29.jpg","width":320,"height":183},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Dartmouth_Gospel_Choir_at_the_Gospel_Brunch_%283232282945%29.jpg","width":2048,"height":1169},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1280747246","tid":"dbf06f56-0234-11f0-8bbc-6a018e9286c8","timestamp":"2025-03-16T07:04:10Z","description":"Genre of music emphasizing Christian lyrics","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gospel_music"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Gospel_music","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gospel_music"}},"extract":"Gospel music is a traditional genre of Christian music and a cornerstone of Christian media.
