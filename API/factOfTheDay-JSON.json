It consists of the shortest wavelength electromagnetic waves, typically shorter than those of X-rays. With frequencies above 30 exahertz (3×1019 Hz), each gamma ray imparts the highest photon energy of any form of electromagnetic radiation. Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900 while studying radiation emitted by radium.

According to the government Scottish Household Survey in 2019, 20% of the Scottish population identified the Church of Scotland as their religious identity. The Church of Scotland's governing system is presbyterian in its approach, therefore, no one individual or group within the church has more or less influence over church matters. There is no one person who acts as the head of faith, as the church believes that role is the \"Lord God's\".</p>","normalizedtitle":"Church of Scotland"},{"type":"standard","title":"Charles_I_of_England","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Charles I of England</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q81506","titles":{"canonical":"Charles_I_of_England","normalized":"Charles I of England","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Charles I of England</span>"},"pageid":7426,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/King_Charles_I_after_original_by_van_Dyck.jpg/320px-King_Charles_I_after_original_by_van_Dyck.jpg","width":320,"height":552},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/King_Charles_I_after_original_by_van_Dyck.jpg","width":2317,"height":4000},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1210697878","tid":"926bbcd0-d5c2-11ee-96df-9d06086c6dd0","timestamp":"2024-02-27T22:50:06Z","description":"King of England, Scotland and Ireland from 1625 to 1649","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Charles_I_of_England"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Charles_I_of_England","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Charles_I_of_England"}},"extract":"Charles I was King of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649.","extract_html":"<p><b>Charles I</b> was King of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Charles I of England"}],"year":1638},{"text":"Rebel leader Liu Bang declared himself Emperor Gaozu of Han after overthrowing the Qin dynasty, the first imperial dynasty of China.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Emperor Gaozu of Han</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q7210","titles":{"canonical":"Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han","normalized":"Emperor Gaozu of Han","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Emperor Gaozu of Han</span>"},"pageid":338378,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Liu-bang.jpg/320px-Liu-bang.jpg","width":320,"height":366},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Liu-bang.jpg","width":560,"height":641},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1210338804","tid":"cc289c30-d45b-11ee-ad64-a99577878d2d","timestamp":"2024-02-26T04:01:57Z","description":"Emperor of the Han dynasty (202–195 BC)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han"}},"extract":"Emperor Gaozu of Han, also known by his given name Liu Bang (劉邦), was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202 to 195 BC.
