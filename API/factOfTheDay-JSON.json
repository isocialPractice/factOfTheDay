The name honors the nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, who played a leading role in the discovery of the heaviest elements in the periodic table.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Oganesson"},{"type":"standard","title":"Russian_Academy_of_Sciences","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Russian Academy of Sciences</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q83172","titles":{"canonical":"Russian_Academy_of_Sciences","normalized":"Russian Academy of Sciences","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Russian Academy of Sciences</span>"},"pageid":374556,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Ras-logo.svg/320px-Ras-logo.svg.png","width":320,"height":160},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Ras-logo.svg/100px-Ras-logo.svg.png","width":100,"height":50},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1277936503","tid":"9a1b97e6-f521-11ef-bb32-83a2249b5cfc","timestamp":"2025-02-27T15:43:34Z","description":"National public knowledge, learning, and research institution of Russia","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":55.71083333,"lon":37.57805556},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Russian_Academy_of_Sciences"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Russian_Academy_of_Sciences"}},"extract":"The Russian Academy of Sciences consists of the national academy of Russia; a network of scientific research institutes from across the Russian Federation; and additional scientific and social units such as libraries, publishing units, and hospitals.
