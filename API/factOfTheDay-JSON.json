The twenty-fifth named storm and twelfth typhoon of the 2025 Pacific typhoon season, Kalmaegi originated from an area of convection on October 30. The following day, it was later classified as a tropical depression as the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 02:00 UTC. At 12:00 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system to a tropical storm and assigned it the name Kalmaegi, as environmental conditions became increasingly favorable for development. The JTWC followed suit at 21:00 UTC, also designating it as a tropical storm. The system entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) at 05:30 PHT on November 2 and was named Tino by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). At 12:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded Kalmaegi to a severe tropical storm.

These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the outstreaming solar wind plasma acting upon the nucleus of the comet.
