Reasons were varied but mainly targeted growing economic inequality, corporate influence over government and international institutions, and the lack of truly democratic institutions allowing direct public participation at all levels, local to global. Global demonstrations were held on 15 October in more than 950 cities in 82 countries. The date was chosen to coincide with the 5-month anniversary of the first protest in Spain. General assemblies, the social network n-1, mailing lists, Mumble voice chat, open pads such as Pirate Pad and Titan Pad, and Facebook were used to coordinate the events. Some protests were only a few hundred in number, whereas others numbered in the hundreds of thousands, with the largest in Madrid numbering half a million and the second largest city Barcelona with 400,000.</p>","normalizedtitle":"15 October 2011 global protests"}],"year":2011},{"text":"New Zealand Police conducted several anti-terrorism raids in relation to the discovery of an alleged paramilitary training camp in the Urewera mountain ranges, arresting 17 people and seizing four guns and 230 rounds of ammunition.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"New_Zealand_Police","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">New Zealand Police</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q12063956","titles":{"canonical":"New_Zealand_Police","normalized":"New Zealand Police","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">New Zealand Police</span>"},"pageid":406756,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/NZP-ConstableBadge.png/330px-NZP-ConstableBadge.png","width":320,"height":415},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/NZP-ConstableBadge.png","width":617,"height":800},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1316888509","tid":"253f876c-a96b-11f0-9706-7d9c0283b52b","timestamp":"2025-10-15T02:03:30Z","description":"National police service of New Zealand","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":-41.2734,"lon":174.7782},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Police","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Police?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Police?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:New_Zealand_Police"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Police","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/New_Zealand_Police","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Police?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:New_Zealand_Police"}},"extract":"The New Zealand Police is the national police service and principal law enforcement agency of New Zealand, responsible for preventing crime, enhancing public safety, bringing offenders to justice, and maintaining public order.

Designed primarily by sculptor Yevgeny Vuchetich with assistance from architect Yakov Belopolsky, the concrete sculpture commemorates the casualties of the Battle of Stalingrad, and is the predominant component of a monument complex, which includes several plazas and other sculptural works. Standing 85 metres (279 ft) tall from the base of its pedestal to its peak, the statue was the tallest in the world upon its completion in 1967, and is the tallest statue in Europe if including the pedestal. The statue, along with the rest of the complex, was dedicated on 15 October 1967, and has been listed as a tentative candidate for UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites since 2014.</p>","normalizedtitle":"The Motherland Calls"},{"type":"standard","title":"Volgograd","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Volgograd</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q914","titles":{"canonical":"Volgograd","normalized":"Volgograd","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Volgograd</span>"},"pageid":32585,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/MotherlandCalls1984.jpg/330px-MotherlandCalls1984.jpg","width":320,"height":307},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/MotherlandCalls1984.jpg","width":5000,"height":4790},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1314631817","tid":"4d53dfb0-9f8e-11f0-8e76-4eb52372fce2","timestamp":"2025-10-02T12:49:58Z","description":"City in Volgograd Oblast, Russia","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":48.70861111,"lon":44.51472222},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volgograd","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volgograd?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volgograd?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Volgograd"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volgograd","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Volgograd","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volgograd?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Volgograd"}},"extract":"Volgograd, formerly Tsaritsyn (1589–1925) and Stalingrad (1925–1961), is the largest city and the administrative centre of Volgograd Oblast, Russia.
