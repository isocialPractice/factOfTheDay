Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. In the case of a tie after four quarters, the game enters overtime.</p>","normalizedtitle":"American football"}],"year":1892},{"text":"Led by the voivode Basarab I, Wallachian forces defeated the Hungarian army in an ambush at the Battle of Posada (depicted).","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Voivode","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Voivode</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q275102","titles":{"canonical":"Voivode","normalized":"Voivode","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Voivode</span>"},"pageid":149044,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Voivode_Hrvoje_Vukcic_Hrvatinic.jpg/330px-Voivode_Hrvoje_Vukcic_Hrvatinic.jpg","width":320,"height":443},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Voivode_Hrvoje_Vukcic_Hrvatinic.jpg","width":674,"height":934},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1321352570","tid":"4e6efc5a-bdd7-11f0-8500-fad307d064c6","timestamp":"2025-11-10T01:48:08Z","description":"Historical Slavic noble title","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voivode","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voivode?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voivode?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Voivode"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voivode","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Voivode","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voivode?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Voivode"}},"extract":"Voivode, also spelled voivod, voievod or voevod and also known as vaivode, voivoda, vojvoda, vaivada or wojewoda, is a title denoting a military leader or warlord in Central, Southeastern and Eastern Europe in use since the Early Middle Ages.
