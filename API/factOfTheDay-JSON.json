Crimes currently punishable by death are set out in the Penal Code of Bangladesh. These include waging war against the state, abetting mutiny, giving false evidence upon which an innocent person suffers death, murder, assisted suicide of a child, attempted murder of a child, and killing. The <i>Code of Criminal Procedure</i> 1898 provides that a person given the death penalty \"be hanged by the neck until he is dead.\" For murder cases, the Appellate Division requires trial courts to weigh aggravating and mitigating factors to determine whether the death penalty is warranted.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Capital punishment in Bangladesh"}],"story":"<!--Nov 17-->Former prime minister of Bangladesh <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Sheikh_Hasina\" title=\"Sheikh Hasina\" id=\"mwBg\">Sheikh Hasina</a> <i id=\"mwBw\">(pictured)</i> is <b id=\"mwCA\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Trial_of_Sheikh_Hasina\" title=\"Trial of Sheikh Hasina\" id=\"mwCQ\">found guilty of crimes against humanity</a></b> <i id=\"mwCg\">in absentia</i> by <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./International_Crimes_Tribunal_(Bangladesh)\" title=\"International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)\" id=\"mwCw\">a Bangladeshi tribunal</a> and <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Capital_punishment_in_Bangladesh\" title=\"Capital punishment in Bangladesh\" id=\"mwDA\">sentenced to death</a>."},{"links":[{"type":"standard","title":"Mariana_dam_disaster","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mariana dam disaster</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q21402069","titles":{"canonical":"Mariana_dam_disaster","normalized":"Mariana dam disaster","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mariana dam disaster</span>"},"pageid":48475234,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Bento_Rodrigues%2C_Mariana%2C_Minas_Gerais_%2822828956680%29.jpg/330px-Bento_Rodrigues%2C_Mariana%2C_Minas_Gerais_%2822828956680%29.jpg","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Bento_Rodrigues%2C_Mariana%2C_Minas_Gerais_%2822828956680%29.jpg","width":1080,"height":720},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1322939229","tid":"feb2c7a5-c4ad-11f0-9ed6-eac97051b886","timestamp":"2025-11-18T18:40:03Z","description":"2015 environmental disaster in Brazil","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":-20.23138889,"lon":-43.4425},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_dam_disaster","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_dam_disaster?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_dam_disaster?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mariana_dam_disaster"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_dam_disaster","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Mariana_dam_disaster","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_dam_disaster?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mariana_dam_disaster"}},"extract":"On 5 November 2015, the Fundão tailings dam at the Germano iron ore mine of the Samarco Mariana Mining Complex near Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil, suffered a catastrophic failure, resulting in flooding that devastated the downstream villages of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo, killing 19 people.

Originally, it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning \"strength\", \"authority\", \"rulership\", derived from the verbal noun سلطة <i><span><i lang=\"ar-Latn\">sulṭah</i></span></i>, meaning \"authority\" or \"power\". Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate. The adjectival form of the word is \"sultanic\", and the state and territories ruled by a sultan, as well as his office, are referred to as a <b>sultanate</b>.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Sultan"},{"type":"standard","title":"Hussein_Shah_of_Johor","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Hussein Shah of Johor</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q4351216","titles":{"canonical":"Hussein_Shah_of_Johor","normalized":"Hussein Shah of Johor","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Hussein Shah of Johor</span>"},"pageid":8106160,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/The_Seal_of_the_Sultan_Hussein_Shah_of_Johor_and_Singapore.jpg/330px-The_Seal_of_the_Sultan_Hussein_Shah_of_Johor_and_Singapore.jpg","width":320,"height":302},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/The_Seal_of_the_Sultan_Hussein_Shah_of_Johor_and_Singapore.jpg","width":561,"height":530},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1316310890","tid":"9ebb4951-a6cf-11f0-9767-9d34f9571cb3","timestamp":"2025-10-11T18:25:10Z","description":"Sultan of the Johor Sultanate (1776–1835)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hussein_Shah_of_Johor"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hussein_Shah_of_Johor"}},"extract":"Sultan Hussein Mua'zzam Shah ibni Mahmud Shah Alam was the 19th ruler of Johor-Riau.
