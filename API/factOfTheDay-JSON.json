The surviving two cabin crew were seated in the rear of the plane, which detached from the fuselage, and were rescued with injuries. Both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) stopped functioning a few seconds before the mayday call, and evidence of a bird strike with a species of migratory duck was later found in both engines, with the right engine having sustained severe bird damage. In July 2025, South Korean media reported that the investigation board found that the crew mistakenly turned off the relatively unscathed left engine rather than the badly damaged right engine.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Jeju Air Flight 2216"},{"type":"standard","title":"Muan_International_Airport","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Muan International Airport</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q484060","titles":{"canonical":"Muan_International_Airport","normalized":"Muan International Airport","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Muan International Airport</span>"},"pageid":10288668,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/Muan_International_Airport_20190520_182652.jpg/330px-Muan_International_Airport_20190520_182652.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/91/Muan_International_Airport_20190520_182652.jpg","width":4272,"height":2403},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1326998164","tid":"95fce913-d6fb-11f0-af55-9b23a4758bc8","timestamp":"2025-12-12T01:40:49Z","description":"Commercial airport in South Jeolla, South Korea","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":34.99138889,"lon":126.38277778},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muan_International_Airport","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muan_International_Airport?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muan_International_Airport?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Muan_International_Airport"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muan_International_Airport","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Muan_International_Airport","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muan_International_Airport?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Muan_International_Airport"}},"extract":"Muan International Airport is an international airport in Muan County, South Jeolla Province, South Korea.
