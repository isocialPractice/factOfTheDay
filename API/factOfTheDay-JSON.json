The Republican nominee, Governor George W. Bush of Texas, the eldest son of George H. W. Bush, narrowly defeated incumbent Democratic Vice President Al Gore. It was the fourth of five U.S. presidential elections, and the first since 1888, in which the winning candidate lost the popular vote, and is considered one of the closest U.S. presidential elections, with long-standing controversy about the result. Gore conceded the election on December 13.</p>","normalizedtitle":"2000 United States presidential election"},{"views":126601,"rank":28,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-11-01Z","views":153824},{"date":"2024-11-02Z","views":163280},{"date":"2024-11-03Z","views":167085},{"date":"2024-11-04Z","views":144893},{"date":"2024-11-05Z","views":126601}],"type":"standard","title":"Amaran_(2024_film)","displaytitle":"<i>Amaran</i> (2024 film)","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q123119123","titles":{"canonical":"Amaran_(2024_film)","normalized":"Amaran (2024 film)","display":"<i>Amaran</i> (2024 film)"},"pageid":74337500,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/Amaran_2024_poster.jpg","width":258,"height":387},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/Amaran_2024_poster.jpg","width":258,"height":387},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1255641983","tid":"e33f8c24-9bcc-11ef-82ee-df4b26d66c61","timestamp":"2024-11-05T23:22:56Z","description":"2024 Indian film by Rajkumar Periasamy","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaran_(2024_film)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaran_(2024_film)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaran_(2024_film)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Amaran_(2024_film)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaran_(2024_film)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Amaran_(2024_film)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaran_(2024_film)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Amaran_(2024_film)"}},"extract":"Amaran is a 2024 Indian Tamil-language biographical action war film directed by Rajkumar Periasamy and produced by Raaj Kamal Films International, together with Sony Pictures Films India.

The state has important Mayan and colonial sites; however, these are not as well-known or visited as much as others in the Yucatán.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Campeche"}],"story":"<!--Nov 01-->The ruins of a <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Maya_civilization\" title=\"Maya civilization\" id=\"mwFQ\">Maya</a> city, dubbed <b id=\"mwFg\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Valeriana_(city)\" title=\"Valeriana (city)\" id=\"mwFw\">Valeriana</a></b>, are discovered in <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Campeche\" title=\"Campeche\" id=\"mwGA\">Campeche</a>, Mexico."}],"onthisday":[{"text":"Syrian civil war: The Syrian Democratic Forces launched a successful military campaign to isolate and eventually capture Raqqa, the Islamic State's capital.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Syrian_civil_war","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Syrian civil war</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q178810","titles":{"canonical":"Syrian_civil_war","normalized":"Syrian civil war","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Syrian civil war</span>"},"pageid":30741795,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Destroyed_neighborhood_in_Raqqa.png/320px-Destroyed_neighborhood_in_Raqqa.png","width":320,"height":154},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Destroyed_neighborhood_in_Raqqa.png","width":1800,"height":865},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1253892371","tid":"483e1fb9-9529-11ef-b783-523e0f341922","timestamp":"2024-10-28T12:36:41Z","description":"Multi-sided war in Syria (2011–present)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Syrian_civil_war"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Syrian_civil_war","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Syrian_civil_war"}},"extract":"The Syrian civil war is an ongoing multi-sided conflict in Syria involving various state-sponsored and non-state actors.\nIn March 2011, popular discontent with the rule of Bashar al-Assad triggered large-scale protests and pro-democracy rallies across Syria, as part of the wider Arab Spring protests in the region.
