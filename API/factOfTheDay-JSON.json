Greenland lies between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. It is the world's largest island, and is the location of the northernmost point of land in the worldâ€”Kaffeklubben Island off the northern coast is the world's northernmost undisputed point of land; Cape Morris Jesup on the mainland was thought to be so until the 1960s. Economically, Greenland is heavily reliant on aid from Denmark, amounting to near half of the territory's total public revenue.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Greenland"},{"views":144044,"rank":12,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-01-06Z","views":758},{"date":"2025-01-07Z","views":13666},{"date":"2025-01-08Z","views":152631},{"date":"2025-01-09Z","views":209909},{"date":"2025-01-10Z","views":144044}],"type":"standard","title":"Pacific_Palisades,_Los_Angeles","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1370207","titles":{"canonical":"Pacific_Palisades,_Los_Angeles","normalized":"Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles</span>"},"pageid":430202,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Pacific_Palisades_Photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg/320px-Pacific_Palisades_Photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Pacific_Palisades_Photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg","width":3968,"height":2232},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1268703653","tid":"b93f9550-cfcc-11ef-924f-afe601c9607c","timestamp":"2025-01-11T03:32:46Z","description":"Neighborhood in California, US","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":34.04805556,"lon":-118.52694444},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Palisades%2C_Los_Angeles","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Palisades%2C_Los_Angeles?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Palisades%2C_Los_Angeles?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pacific_Palisades%2C_Los_Angeles"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Palisades%2C_Los_Angeles","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Pacific_Palisades%2C_Los_Angeles","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Palisades%2C_Los_Angeles?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pacific_Palisades%2C_Los_Angeles"}},"extract":"Pacific Palisades is a neighborhood in the Westside region of Los Angeles, California, situated about 20 miles (32Â km) west of Downtown Los Angeles.","extract_html":"<p><b>Pacific Palisades</b> is a neighborhood in the Westside region of Los Angeles, California, situated about 20 miles (32Â km) west of Downtown Los Angeles.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles"},{"views":128036,"rank":13,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-01-06Z","views":452},{"date":"2025-01-07Z","views":471},{"date":"2025-01-08Z","views":719},{"date":"2025-01-09Z","views":545},{"date":"2025-01-10Z","views":128036}],"type":"standard","title":"Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Disposable household and per capita income</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1591167","titles":{"canonical":"Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income","normalized":"Disposable household and per capita income","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Disposable household and per capita income</span>"},"pageid":5888869,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1262926880","tid":"4965d140-b984-11ef-b723-ea1c43bcde59","timestamp":"2024-12-13T18:58:49Z","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income"}},"extract":"Household income is a measure of income received by the household sector.
