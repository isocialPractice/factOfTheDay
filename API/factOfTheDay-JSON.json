Due to the action of winds, currents and temperature fluctuations, sea ice is very dynamic, leading to a wide variety of ice types and features. Sea ice may be contrasted with icebergs, which are chunks of ice shelves or glaciers that calve into the ocean. Depending on location, sea ice expanses may also incorporate icebergs.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Sea ice"},{"type":"standard","title":"Pituffik_Space_Base","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pituffik Space Base</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q131520504","titles":{"canonical":"Pituffik_Space_Base","normalized":"Pituffik Space Base","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pituffik Space Base</span>"},"pageid":750735,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Aerial_Picture_Of_Thule_Air_Base.jpg/320px-Aerial_Picture_Of_Thule_Air_Base.jpg","width":320,"height":228},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Aerial_Picture_Of_Thule_Air_Base.jpg","width":800,"height":571},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1270214264","tid":"e926ff6f-d59d-11ef-8958-0cc6b541d643","timestamp":"2025-01-18T13:12:47Z","description":"US space base in Greenland","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":76.53111111,"lon":-68.70305556},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituffik_Space_Base","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituffik_Space_Base?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituffik_Space_Base?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pituffik_Space_Base"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituffik_Space_Base","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Pituffik_Space_Base","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituffik_Space_Base?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pituffik_Space_Base"}},"extract":"Pituffik Space Base, formerly and perhaps better known as Thule Air Base, is a United States Space Force base located on the northwest coast of Greenland.
