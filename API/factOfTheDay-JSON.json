The most recent hat-trick was taken by South Africa's spin bowler Keshav Maharaj against the West Indies in June 2021 at Daren Sammy Cricket Ground in Gros Islet, Saint Lucia.</p>","normalizedtitle":"List of Test cricket hat-tricks"},{"type":"standard","title":"Over_(cricket)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Over (cricket)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1210093","titles":{"canonical":"Over_(cricket)","normalized":"Over (cricket)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Over (cricket)</span>"},"pageid":463787,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/At_the_Cricket_5_%28geograph_4111292%29.jpg/320px-At_the_Cricket_5_%28geograph_4111292%29.jpg","width":320,"height":214},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/At_the_Cricket_5_%28geograph_4111292%29.jpg","width":5478,"height":3663},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1169010029","tid":"9e23ffa0-67cd-11ee-92ed-431d6fa1b451","timestamp":"2023-08-06T13:27:01Z","description":"Cricket terminology","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Over_(cricket)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Over_(cricket)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Over_(cricket)"}},"extract":"In cricket, an over consists of six legal deliveries bowled from one end of a cricket pitch to the player batting at the other end, almost always by a single bowler.","extract_html":"<p>In cricket, an <b>over</b> consists of six legal deliveries bowled from one end of a cricket pitch to the player batting at the other end, almost always by a single bowler.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Over (cricket)"}],"year":2006},{"text":"The first major ground engagement of the Gulf War began with the Iraqi invasion of Khafji, Saudi Arabia, recaptured three days later by Coalition forces.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Battle_of_Khafji","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Battle of Khafji</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q718770","titles":{"canonical":"Battle_of_Khafji","normalized":"Battle of Khafji","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Battle of Khafji</span>"},"pageid":1237273,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Battle_of_Khafji_1991.svg/320px-Battle_of_Khafji_1991.svg.png","width":320,"height":244},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Battle_of_Khafji_1991.svg/800px-Battle_of_Khafji_1991.svg.png","width":800,"height":609},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1200157135","tid":"861c9fe0-be2e-11ee-8d25-a35220251ee0","timestamp":"2024-01-28T22:42:30Z","description":"1991 battle of the Gulf War","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":28.41666667,"lon":48.5},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Khafji","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Khafji?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Khafji?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Khafji"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Khafji","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Battle_of_Khafji","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Khafji?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Khafji"}},"extract":"The Battle of Khafji was the first major ground engagement of the Gulf War.
