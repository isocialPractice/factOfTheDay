Thơ was appointed to head a civilian cabinet by the military junta of General Dương Văn Minh, which came to power after overthrowing and assassinating Diệm, the nation's first president. Thơ's rule was marked by a period of confusion and weak government, as the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC) and the civilian cabinet vied for power. Thơ lost his job and retired from politics when Minh's junta was deposed in a January 1964 coup by General Nguyễn Khánh.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ"},{"type":"standard","title":"Dương_Văn_Minh","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Dương Văn Minh</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q334419","titles":{"canonical":"Dương_Văn_Minh","normalized":"Dương Văn Minh","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Dương Văn Minh</span>"},"pageid":80086,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Portrait_of_D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_V%C4%83n_Minh%2C_Vietnam_Fights_and_Builds_No.1%2C_July_1964.jpg/330px-Portrait_of_D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_V%C4%83n_Minh%2C_Vietnam_Fights_and_Builds_No.1%2C_July_1964.jpg","width":320,"height":475},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Portrait_of_D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_V%C4%83n_Minh%2C_Vietnam_Fights_and_Builds_No.1%2C_July_1964.jpg","width":722,"height":1071},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1320594504","tid":"9658f2af-ba70-11f0-82ff-0428719418a0","timestamp":"2025-11-05T17:55:17Z","description":"Last President of South Vietnam in 1975","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_V%C4%83n_Minh","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_V%C4%83n_Minh?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_V%C4%83n_Minh?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_V%C4%83n_Minh"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_V%C4%83n_Minh","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_V%C4%83n_Minh","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_V%C4%83n_Minh?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_V%C4%83n_Minh"}},"extract":"Dương Văn Minh, popularly known as Big Minh, was a South Vietnamese politician and a senior general in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and a politician during the presidency of Ngô Đình Diệm.
