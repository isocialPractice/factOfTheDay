He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy, which was formed from Lee's experiences in unarmed fighting and self-defense—as well as eclectic, Zen Buddhist and Taoist philosophies—as a new school of martial arts thought. With a film career spanning Hong Kong and the United States, Lee is regarded as the first global Chinese film star and one of the most influential martial artists in the history of cinema. Known for his roles in five feature-length martial arts films, Lee is credited with helping to popularize martial arts films in the 1970s and promoting Hong Kong action cinema.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Bruce Lee"},{"views":113853,"rank":24,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-12-12Z","views":163707},{"date":"2025-12-13Z","views":186647},{"date":"2025-12-14Z","views":176532},{"date":"2025-12-15Z","views":143968},{"date":"2025-12-16Z","views":113853}],"type":"standard","title":"Rehman_Dakait","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Rehman Dakait</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q7309814","titles":{"canonical":"Rehman_Dakait","normalized":"Rehman Dakait","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Rehman Dakait</span>"},"pageid":23926607,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/79/Rehman_Dakait.png","width":180,"height":300},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/79/Rehman_Dakait.png","width":180,"height":300},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1327931640","tid":"19d81b83-dad4-11f0-8cf5-20c577fe2595","timestamp":"2025-12-16T23:08:15Z","description":"Pakistani gangster (1980–2009)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehman_Dakait","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehman_Dakait?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehman_Dakait?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rehman_Dakait"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehman_Dakait","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Rehman_Dakait","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehman_Dakait?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rehman_Dakait"}},"extract":"Rehman Baloch, alias Rehman Dakait, was a Pakistani gangster based in Karachi's Lyari neighbourhood who formed the Peoples' Aman Committee.","extract_html":"<p><b>Rehman Baloch</b>, alias <b>Rehman Dakait</b>, was a Pakistani gangster based in Karachi's Lyari neighbourhood who formed the Peoples' Aman Committee.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Rehman Dakait"},{"views":109277,"rank":26,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-12-13Z","views":10633},{"date":"2025-12-14Z","views":149946},{"date":"2025-12-15Z","views":157272},{"date":"2025-12-16Z","views":109277}],"type":"standard","title":"2025_Brown_University_shooting","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">2025 Brown University shooting</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q137382041","titles":{"canonical":"2025_Brown_University_shooting","normalized":"2025 Brown University shooting","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">2025 Brown University shooting</span>"},"pageid":81835929,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Flowers_at_Brown%27s_Engineering_Research_Center.jpg/330px-Flowers_at_Brown%27s_Engineering_Research_Center.jpg","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Flowers_at_Brown%27s_Engineering_Research_Center.jpg","width":3600,"height":2700},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1327983185","tid":"e19ffed0-db0a-11f0-9e6a-ce4f98729ac5","timestamp":"2025-12-17T05:40:23Z","description":"Mass shooting in Rhode Island, US","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":41.8265,"lon":-71.3979},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Brown_University_shooting","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Brown_University_shooting?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Brown_University_shooting?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2025_Brown_University_shooting"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Brown_University_shooting","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/2025_Brown_University_shooting","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Brown_University_shooting?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2025_Brown_University_shooting"}},"extract":"On December 13, 2025, a mass shooting occurred at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, during the second day of final examination week for the fall semester.
