A hurricane is a strong tropical cyclone that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean or northeastern Pacific Ocean. A typhoon is the same thing which occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. In the Indian Ocean and South Pacific, comparable storms are referred to as \"tropical cyclones\". In modern times, on average around 80 to 90 named tropical cyclones form each year around the world, over half of which develop hurricane-force winds of 65 kn or more.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Tropical cyclone"},{"type":"standard","title":"Maximum_sustained_wind","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Maximum sustained wind</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q6795923","titles":{"canonical":"Maximum_sustained_wind","normalized":"Maximum sustained wind","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Maximum sustained wind</span>"},"pageid":14633336,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1314768761","tid":"cdb9252e-a00c-11f0-91ab-a84ccff6ba0e","timestamp":"2025-10-03T03:55:30Z","description":"Intensity indicator of tropical cyclone","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Maximum_sustained_wind"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Maximum_sustained_wind","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Maximum_sustained_wind"}},"extract":"\nThe maximum sustained wind associated with a tropical cyclone is a common \nindicator of the intensity of the storm.
