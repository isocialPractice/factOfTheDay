Federal Megan's Law was enacted as a subsection of the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act of 1994, which merely required sex offenders to register with local law enforcement. Since only a few states required registration prior to Megan's death, the state-level legislation to bring states in compliance—with both the <i>registration</i> requirement of Jacob Wetterling Act and <i>community notification</i> required by federal Megan's Law—were crafted simultaneously and are often referred to as \"Megan's Laws\" of individual states. Thus, the federal Megan's Law refers to <i>community notification</i>, whereas state-level \"Megan's Law\" may refer to both <i>sex offender registration</i> and <i>community notification</i>.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Megan's Law"},{"views":76380,"rank":34,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-01-26Z","views":3238},{"date":"2024-01-27Z","views":3173},{"date":"2024-01-28Z","views":3629},{"date":"2024-01-29Z","views":7642},{"date":"2024-01-30Z","views":76380}],"type":"standard","title":"The_Ministry_of_Ungentlemanly_Warfare","displaytitle":"<i>The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q115860236","titles":{"canonical":"The_Ministry_of_Ungentlemanly_Warfare","normalized":"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","display":"<i>The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare</i>"},"pageid":72125152,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/22/The_Ministry_of_Ungentlemanly_Warfare_poster.jpg","width":316,"height":316},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/22/The_Ministry_of_Ungentlemanly_Warfare_poster.jpg","width":316,"height":316},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1201144224","tid":"9185c8a0-bfd4-11ee-b734-69e1ec5d02f6","timestamp":"2024-01-31T01:03:37Z","description":"Film by Guy Ritchie","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_of_Ungentlemanly_Warfare","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_of_Ungentlemanly_Warfare?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_of_Ungentlemanly_Warfare?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Ministry_of_Ungentlemanly_Warfare"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_of_Ungentlemanly_Warfare","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/The_Ministry_of_Ungentlemanly_Warfare","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_of_Ungentlemanly_Warfare?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Ministry_of_Ungentlemanly_Warfare"}},"extract":"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is an upcoming action spy film directed and co-written by Guy Ritchie, based on the 2014 book Churchill's Secret Warriors: The Explosive True Story of the Special Forces Desperadoes of WWII by Damien Lewis.","extract_html":"<p><i><b>The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare</b></i> is an upcoming action spy film directed and co-written by Guy Ritchie, based on the 2014 book <i>Churchill's Secret Warriors: The Explosive True Story of the Special Forces Desperadoes of WWII</i> by Damien Lewis.</p>","normalizedtitle":"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare"},{"views":75928,"rank":35,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-01-26Z","views":12054},{"date":"2024-01-27Z","views":18632},{"date":"2024-01-28Z","views":82900},{"date":"2024-01-29Z","views":126121},{"date":"2024-01-30Z","views":75928}],"type":"standard","title":"Munawar_Faruqui","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Munawar Faruqui</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q104979534","titles":{"canonical":"Munawar_Faruqui","normalized":"Munawar Faruqui","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Munawar Faruqui</span>"},"pageid":67856095,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Photos-Munawar-Faruqui-snapped-in-Andheri-1_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":257,"height":253},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Photos-Munawar-Faruqui-snapped-in-Andheri-1_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":257,"height":253},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1200884773","tid":"d1e28d50-bf6d-11ee-92bb-5dd4fc22cac2","timestamp":"2024-01-30T12:48:07Z","description":"Indian stand-up comedian (born 1992)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munawar_Faruqui","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munawar_Faruqui?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munawar_Faruqui?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Munawar_Faruqui"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munawar_Faruqui","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Munawar_Faruqui","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munawar_Faruqui?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Munawar_Faruqui"}},"extract":"Munawar Iqbal Faruqui is an Indian stand-up comedian, rapper and singer.
