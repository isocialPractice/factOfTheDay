The Docklands' regeneration began later that decade; it has been redeveloped principally for commercial and residential use. The name \"London Docklands\" was used for the first time in a government report on redevelopment plans in 1971 and has since been almost universally adopted. The redevelopment created wealth, but also led to some conflict between the new and old communities in the area.","extract_html":"<p><b>London Docklands</b> is the riverfront and former docks in London.
