From the eighth century until 1870, the pope was the sovereign or head of state of the Papal States, and since 1929 of the much smaller Vatican City state. From a Catholic viewpoint, the primacy of the bishop of Rome is largely derived from his role as the apostolic successor to Saint Peter, to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus, who gave Peter the Keys of Heaven and the powers of \"binding and loosing\", naming him as the \"rock\" upon which the Church would be built. The reigning pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Pope"},{"type":"standard","title":"Pope_Alexander_VIII","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pope Alexander VIII</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q101294","titles":{"canonical":"Pope_Alexander_VIII","normalized":"Pope Alexander VIII","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pope Alexander VIII</span>"},"pageid":23790,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Portrait_of_Pope_Alexander_VIII_%E2%80%93_Roman_School_of_17th_Century_%E2%80%93_%28unframed%29.jpg/320px-Portrait_of_Pope_Alexander_VIII_%E2%80%93_Roman_School_of_17th_Century_%E2%80%93_%28unframed%29.jpg","width":320,"height":437},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Portrait_of_Pope_Alexander_VIII_%E2%80%93_Roman_School_of_17th_Century_%E2%80%93_%28unframed%29.jpg","width":583,"height":797},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1270697224","tid":"aff0ccfa-d76c-11ef-a6c8-33aabad01834","timestamp":"2025-01-20T20:25:28Z","description":"Head of the Catholic Church from 1689 to 1691","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VIII","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VIII?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VIII?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pope_Alexander_VIII"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VIII","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Pope_Alexander_VIII","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VIII?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pope_Alexander_VIII"}},"extract":"Pope Alexander VIII, born Pietro Vito Ottoboni, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 6 October 1689 to his death in February 1691.","extract_html":"<p><b>Pope Alexander VIII</b>, born <b>Pietro Vito Ottoboni</b>, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 6 October 1689 to his death in February 1691.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Pope Alexander VIII"}],"year":1691},{"text":"Queen Isabella I issued an edict outlawing Islam in the Crown of Castile, forcing virtually all her Muslim subjects to convert to Christianity.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Isabella_I_of_Castile","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Isabella I of Castile</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q45859","titles":{"canonical":"Isabella_I_of_Castile","normalized":"Isabella I of Castile","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Isabella I of Castile</span>"},"pageid":23909513,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/IsabellaofCastile03.jpg/320px-IsabellaofCastile03.jpg","width":320,"height":396},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/IsabellaofCastile03.jpg","width":2087,"height":2582},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1275230290","tid":"681b1e48-e8b8-11ef-9781-df9771e36cc2","timestamp":"2025-02-11T20:40:19Z","description":"Queen of Castile and León from 1474 to 1504","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_I_of_Castile","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_I_of_Castile?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_I_of_Castile?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Isabella_I_of_Castile"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_I_of_Castile","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Isabella_I_of_Castile","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_I_of_Castile?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Isabella_I_of_Castile"}},"extract":"Isabella I, also called Isabella the Catholic, was Queen of Castile and León from 1474 until her death in 1504.
