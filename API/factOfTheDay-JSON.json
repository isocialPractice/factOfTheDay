From the High Middle Ages, his feast day has been associated with a tradition of courtly love. He is also a patron saint of Terni, epilepsy, and beekeepers. Saint Valentine was a clergyman – either a priest or a bishop – in the Roman Empire who ministered to persecuted Christians. He was martyred and his body buried on the Via Flaminia on February 14, which has been observed as the Feast of Saint Valentine since at least the eighth century.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Saint Valentine"},{"views":63498,"rank":40,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-02-11Z","views":109015},{"date":"2025-02-12Z","views":107255},{"date":"2025-02-13Z","views":107863},{"date":"2025-02-14Z","views":84686},{"date":"2025-02-15Z","views":63498}],"type":"standard","title":"ChatGPT","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">ChatGPT</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q115564437","titles":{"canonical":"ChatGPT","normalized":"ChatGPT","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">ChatGPT</span>"},"pageid":72417803,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/ChatGPT-Logo.svg/320px-ChatGPT-Logo.svg.png","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/ChatGPT-Logo.svg/512px-ChatGPT-Logo.svg.png","width":512,"height":512},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1275978877","tid":"8b311ffc-ec24-11ef-b060-88be85ebc175","timestamp":"2025-02-16T05:11:57Z","description":"Chatbot developed by OpenAI","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:ChatGPT"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/ChatGPT","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:ChatGPT"}},"extract":"ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in 2022.
