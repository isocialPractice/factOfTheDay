Wat Phra Dhammakaya plays a leading role in Thai Buddhism, with theologian Edward Irons describing it as \"the face of modern Thai Buddhism\".</p>","normalizedtitle":"Wat Phra Dhammakaya"},{"type":"standard","title":"Pathum_Thani_province","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pathum Thani province</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q459748","titles":{"canonical":"Pathum_Thani_province","normalized":"Pathum Thani province","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pathum Thani province</span>"},"pageid":364845,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/D85_3734_%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%93%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%96%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%AB%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B4_The_National_Memorial_of_Thailand_Photographed_by_Trisorn_Triboon_%2830%29.jpg/320px-D85_3734_%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%93%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%96%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%AB%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B4_The_National_Memorial_of_Thailand_Photographed_by_Trisorn_Triboon_%2830%29.jpg","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/D85_3734_%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%93%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%96%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%AB%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B4_The_National_Memorial_of_Thailand_Photographed_by_Trisorn_Triboon_%2830%29.jpg","width":8256,"height":5504},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1276013752","tid":"4d9ac0f3-ec59-11ef-9a2e-8f7c9b82def4","timestamp":"2025-02-16T11:29:37Z","description":"Province of Thailand","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":14.02083333,"lon":100.52472222},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathum_Thani_province","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathum_Thani_province?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathum_Thani_province?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pathum_Thani_province"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathum_Thani_province","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Pathum_Thani_province","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathum_Thani_province?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pathum_Thani_province"}},"extract":"Pathum Thani is one of the central provinces (changwat) of Thailand.
