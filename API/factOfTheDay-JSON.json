The term <i>anti-war</i> can also refer to pacifism, which is the opposition to all use of military force during conflicts, or to anti-war books, paintings, and other works of art. Some activists distinguish between anti-war movements and peace movements. Anti-war activists work through protest and other grassroots means to attempt to pressure a government to put an end to a particular war or conflict or to prevent one from arising.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Anti-war movement"},{"type":"standard","title":"15_February_2003_anti-war_protests","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">15 February 2003 anti-war protests</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2580246","titles":{"canonical":"15_February_2003_anti-war_protests","normalized":"15 February 2003 anti-war protests","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">15 February 2003 anti-war protests</span>"},"pageid":2657617,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/London_anti-war_protest_banners.jpg/320px-London_anti-war_protest_banners.jpg","width":320,"height":427},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/London_anti-war_protest_banners.jpg","width":600,"height":800},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1271048359","tid":"58f50685-d8b2-11ef-9c93-94173fc038ff","timestamp":"2025-01-22T11:16:38Z","description":"Coordinated day of protests in over 600 cities against the War in Iraq","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_February_2003_anti-war_protests","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_February_2003_anti-war_protests?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_February_2003_anti-war_protests?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:15_February_2003_anti-war_protests"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_February_2003_anti-war_protests","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/15_February_2003_anti-war_protests","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_February_2003_anti-war_protests?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:15_February_2003_anti-war_protests"}},"extract":"On 15 February 2003, a coordinated day of protests was held across the world in which people in more than 600 cities expressed opposition to the imminent Iraq War.

Among the first territories to be attacked were those on the coast of the island of Ceylon, with operations initially focused on the trading port at Trincomalee.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Invasion of Ceylon"},{"type":"standard","title":"Johan_van_Angelbeek","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Johan van Angelbeek</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q6215437","titles":{"canonical":"Johan_van_Angelbeek","normalized":"Johan van Angelbeek","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Johan van Angelbeek</span>"},"pageid":35669460,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Johan_Gerard_van_Angelbeek.jpg/320px-Johan_Gerard_van_Angelbeek.jpg","width":320,"height":490},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Johan_Gerard_van_Angelbeek.jpg","width":497,"height":761},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1274473430","tid":"1fcfc690-e563-11ef-aa7e-a9129d84d196","timestamp":"2025-02-07T14:52:17Z","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_van_Angelbeek","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_van_Angelbeek?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_van_Angelbeek?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Johan_van_Angelbeek"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_van_Angelbeek","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Johan_van_Angelbeek","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_van_Angelbeek?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Johan_van_Angelbeek"}},"extract":"Johan Gerard van Angelbeek was a Dutch colonial officer who commanded Dutch forces on the island of Ceylon during the colony's final year in the Dutch Empire before its seizure by a British expeditionary force.","extract_html":"<p><b>Johan Gerard van Angelbeek</b> was a Dutch colonial officer who commanded Dutch forces on the island of Ceylon during the colony's final year in the Dutch Empire before its seizure by a British expeditionary force.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Johan van Angelbeek"},{"type":"standard","title":"Batavian_Republic","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Batavian Republic</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q188553","titles":{"canonical":"Batavian_Republic","normalized":"Batavian Republic","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Batavian Republic</span>"},"pageid":51170,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Bataafse_Republiek_nationale_vlag.svg/320px-Bataafse_Republiek_nationale_vlag.svg.png","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Bataafse_Republiek_nationale_vlag.svg/450px-Bataafse_Republiek_nationale_vlag.svg.png","width":450,"height":300},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1274257242","tid":"8bd1015a-e46f-11ef-8c4a-6cc894f5d32c","timestamp":"2025-02-06T09:48:41Z","description":"Dutch predecessor state, 1795–1806","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":52.06666667,"lon":4.3},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batavian_Republic","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batavian_Republic?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batavian_Republic?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Batavian_Republic"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batavian_Republic","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Batavian_Republic","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batavian_Republic?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Batavian_Republic"}},"extract":"The Batavian Republic was the successor state to the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands.
