The DCU is a soft reboot of a previous franchise, the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), retaining select cast members and narrative elements but disregarding others. In contrast with the previous state of DC Comics adaptations, the DCU features a united continuity and story across live-action films and television, animation, and video games. Concurrent DC adaptations that do not fit this continuity are labeled \"<span class=\"mw-selflink-fragment\">DC Elseworlds</span>\".</p>","normalizedtitle":"DC Universe (franchise)"},{"views":52463,"rank":48,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-07-10Z","views":10400},{"date":"2025-07-11Z","views":10995},{"date":"2025-07-12Z","views":24312},{"date":"2025-07-13Z","views":42279},{"date":"2025-07-14Z","views":52463}],"type":"standard","title":"SummerSlam_(2025)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">SummerSlam (2025)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q126488814","titles":{"canonical":"SummerSlam_(2025)","normalized":"SummerSlam (2025)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">SummerSlam (2025)</span>"},"pageid":60009987,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/SummerSlam_2025_poster.jpg","width":282,"height":353},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/SummerSlam_2025_poster.jpg","width":282,"height":353},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1300576318","tid":"1b24a706-6136-11f0-9502-ef8c43099798","timestamp":"2025-07-15T04:42:26Z","description":"WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming event","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam_(2025)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam_(2025)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam_(2025)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:SummerSlam_(2025)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam_(2025)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/SummerSlam_(2025)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam_(2025)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:SummerSlam_(2025)"}},"extract":"The 2025 SummerSlam, also promoted as SummerSlam: New Jersey, is an upcoming professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE.
