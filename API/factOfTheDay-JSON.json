In his comic book appearances, Doctor Doom is depicted as the monarch of Latveria whose goal is to bring order to humanity through world conquest. He serves as the archenemy of Reed Richards and the Fantastic Four, though he has also come into conflict with other superheroes in the Marvel Universe, including Spider-Man, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, the Black Panther, the X-Men, and the Avengers. While usually portrayed as a villain, Doom has also been an antihero at times, working with heroes if their goals align and only if it benefits him.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Doctor Doom"},{"views":99053,"rank":30,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-07-26Z","views":11936},{"date":"2024-07-27Z","views":15730},{"date":"2024-07-28Z","views":79432},{"date":"2024-07-29Z","views":227005},{"date":"2024-07-30Z","views":99053}],"type":"standard","title":"2024_Venezuelan_presidential_election","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">2024 Venezuelan presidential election</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q65072493","titles":{"canonical":"2024_Venezuelan_presidential_election","normalized":"2024 Venezuelan presidential election","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">2024 Venezuelan presidential election</span>"},"pageid":60825396,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Coat_of_arms_of_Venezuela.svg/320px-Coat_of_arms_of_Venezuela.svg.png","width":320,"height":349},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Coat_of_arms_of_Venezuela.svg/512px-Coat_of_arms_of_Venezuela.svg.png","width":512,"height":558},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1237722657","tid":"19001a81-4efa-11ef-bf41-3d63d5ada13d","timestamp":"2024-07-31T05:02:34Z","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Venezuelan_presidential_election","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Venezuelan_presidential_election?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Venezuelan_presidential_election?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2024_Venezuelan_presidential_election"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Venezuelan_presidential_election","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/2024_Venezuelan_presidential_election","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Venezuelan_presidential_election?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2024_Venezuelan_presidential_election"}},"extract":"Presidential elections were held in Venezuela on 28 July 2024 to choose a president for a six-year term beginning on 10 January 2025.

During that period, it was the largest power outage in history by number of people affected, beating the January 2001 blackout in Northern India. Similar conditions caused a blackout on the next day, which remained the largest power outage in history as of June 2024. The outage affected more than 620 million people, spread across 22 states in Northern, Eastern, and Northeast India. An estimated 32 gigawatts of generating capacity was taken offline. Of the affected population, 320 million initially had power, while the rest lacked direct access. Electric service was restored in the affected locations between 31 July and 1 August 2012.</p>","normalizedtitle":"2012 India blackouts"},{"type":"standard","title":"States_and_union_territories_of_India","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">States and union territories of India</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q131541","titles":{"canonical":"States_and_union_territories_of_India","normalized":"States and union territories of India","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">States and union territories of India</span>"},"pageid":375986,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/India-locator-map-blank.svg/320px-India-locator-map-blank.svg.png","width":320,"height":373},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/India-locator-map-blank.svg/1486px-India-locator-map-blank.svg.png","width":1486,"height":1734},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1237228869","tid":"0e8622a2-4d18-11ef-86f9-bb229e977813","timestamp":"2024-07-28T19:31:59Z","description":"Indian national administrative sub-divisions","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:States_and_union_territories_of_India"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/States_and_union_territories_of_India","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:States_and_union_territories_of_India"}},"extract":"India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories, for a total of 36 entities.
