His controversial commentary has resulted in his expulsion from various social media platforms and concern that he promotes misogynist views to his audience. A divisive influencer, Tate has amassed 9.9 million followers on Twitter as of August 2024 and was the third-most googled person in 2023, with most British adults aware of who he is. He has been dubbed the \"king of toxic masculinity\", has called himself a misogynist, and is politically described as both right-wing and far-right. As of March 2025, Tate is facing six legal investigations—four criminal and two civil—in Romania, the United Kingdom, and United States.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Andrew Tate"},{"views":66962,"rank":40,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-03-17Z","views":95365},{"date":"2025-03-18Z","views":146615},{"date":"2025-03-19Z","views":126074},{"date":"2025-03-20Z","views":104069},{"date":"2025-03-21Z","views":66962}],"type":"standard","title":"Karoline_Leavitt","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Karoline Leavitt</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q100146113","titles":{"canonical":"Karoline_Leavitt","normalized":"Karoline Leavitt","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Karoline Leavitt</span>"},"pageid":71739774,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Karoline_Leavitt_%2854360150005%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/330px-Karoline_Leavitt_%2854360150005%29_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":320,"height":426},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Karoline_Leavitt_%2854360150005%29_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":3281,"height":4371},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1281592554","tid":"dda0a4fb-062f-11f0-b7a8-15263e385ff9","timestamp":"2025-03-21T08:38:30Z","description":"White House press secretary (born 1997)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karoline_Leavitt","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karoline_Leavitt?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karoline_Leavitt?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Karoline_Leavitt"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karoline_Leavitt","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Karoline_Leavitt","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karoline_Leavitt?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Karoline_Leavitt"}},"extract":"Karoline Claire Leavitt is an American political aide and government official who has been serving as the 36th White House press secretary in the second Trump administration since January 2025.
