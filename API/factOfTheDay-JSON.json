In popular language, however, the singular <i>European Community</i> was sometimes used interchangeably with the plural phrase, in the sense of referring to all three entities.</p>","normalizedtitle":"European Communities"}],"year":1992},{"text":"The Troubles: The Provisional Irish Republican Army shelled 10 Downing Street with mortars in a failed attempt to assassinate British prime minister John Major.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"The_Troubles","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">The Troubles</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q815436","titles":{"canonical":"The_Troubles","normalized":"The Troubles","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">The Troubles</span>"},"pageid":30770,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Map_of_Ireland%27s_capitals.png/330px-Map_of_Ireland%27s_capitals.png","width":330,"height":421},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Map_of_Ireland%27s_capitals.png","width":1630,"height":2078},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1336038362","tid":"3ba937cc-ff8a-11f0-9f19-33e061a24ccf","timestamp":"2026-02-01T16:22:42Z","description":"1960s–1990s conflict in Northern Ireland","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Troubles"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/The_Troubles","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Troubles"}},"extract":"The Troubles were an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland that lasted for about 30 years from the late 1960s to 1998.
