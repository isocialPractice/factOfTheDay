Central to its ideology is opposition to Western influence and Israeli occupation, which it frames as a struggle for justice and liberation, while also positioning Islam as a comprehensive solution to social and political issues. Hezbollah's ideological framework is articulated through its foundational documents, such as the 1985 \"Open Letter\" and the 2009 \"New Manifesto,\" which emphasize themes of anti-Zionism, anti-Americanism, and the establishment of an Islamic state governed by Sharia. The movement also advocates for pan-Islamism and pan-Arabism, promoting unity among Muslims and Arabs while supporting Iran as a model of sovereignty.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Ideology of Hezbollah"}],"year":1985},{"text":"The Ash Wednesday bushfires burned over half a million acres (over 2,000 km2) each in both South Australia and Victoria, killing 75 people and injuring 2,676 others.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Ash_Wednesday_bushfires","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ash Wednesday bushfires</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1017340","titles":{"canonical":"Ash_Wednesday_bushfires","normalized":"Ash Wednesday bushfires","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ash Wednesday bushfires</span>"},"pageid":1051266,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Burnt_pine_forest_at_Mount_Macedon_after_the_1983_Ash_Wednesday_bushfires.jpg/330px-Burnt_pine_forest_at_Mount_Macedon_after_the_1983_Ash_Wednesday_bushfires.jpg","width":330,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Burnt_pine_forest_at_Mount_Macedon_after_the_1983_Ash_Wednesday_bushfires.jpg","width":1488,"height":960},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1328593420","tid":"5066adac-ddda-11f0-ad27-c09237c21bfe","timestamp":"2025-12-20T19:30:17Z","description":"1983 brushfires in Australia","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Wednesday_bushfires","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Wednesday_bushfires?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Wednesday_bushfires?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ash_Wednesday_bushfires"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Wednesday_bushfires","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Ash_Wednesday_bushfires","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Wednesday_bushfires?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ash_Wednesday_bushfires"}},"extract":"The Ash Wednesday bushfires, known in South Australia as Ash Wednesday II, were a series of bushfires that occurred in south-eastern Australia in 1983 on 16 February.

Republicans were loyal to the left-leaning Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic and included socialists, anarchists, communists and separatists, supported by the Soviet Union. The opposing Nationalists were an alliance of fascist Falangists, monarchists, conservatives and traditionalists, supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy and initially led by a military junta, until General Francisco Franco was appointed supreme leader on 1 October 1936 for what he called the Spanish State. Due to the international political climate at the time, the war was variously viewed as class struggle, religious struggle, or struggle between republican democracy and dictatorship, revolution and counterrevolution, or fascism and communism.
