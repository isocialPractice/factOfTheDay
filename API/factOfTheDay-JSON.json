The paintings—<i>Freedom of Speech</i>, <i>Freedom of Worship</i>, <i>Freedom from Want</i>, and <i>Freedom from Fear</i>—are each approximately 45.75 by 35.5 inches, and are now in the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. The four freedoms refer to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's January 1941 Four Freedoms State of the Union address, in which he identified essential human rights that should be universally protected. The theme was incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and became part of the Charter of the United Nations. The paintings were reproduced in <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> over four consecutive weeks in 1943, alongside essays by prominent thinkers of the day. They became the highlight of a touring exhibition sponsored by <i>The Post</i> and the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
