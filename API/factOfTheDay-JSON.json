Based on the 2015 book <i>Dylan Goes Electric!</i> by Elijah Wald, the film portrays Dylan through his earliest folk music success until the momentous controversy over his use of electric instruments at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Timothée Chalamet stars as Dylan, with Edward Norton, Elle Fanning, Monica Barbaro, Boyd Holbrook, Dan Fogler, Norbert Leo Butz, Eriko Hatsune, Big Bill Morganfield, Will Harrison, and Scoot McNairy in supporting roles. The film's title is derived from the chorus of Dylan's 1965 single \"Like a Rolling Stone\".</p>","normalizedtitle":"A Complete Unknown"},{"views":73972,"rank":48,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-01-19Z","views":39219},{"date":"2025-01-20Z","views":59618},{"date":"2025-01-21Z","views":70879},{"date":"2025-01-22Z","views":61248},{"date":"2025-01-23Z","views":73972}],"type":"standard","title":"Pete_Hegseth","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pete Hegseth</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q7172014","titles":{"canonical":"Pete_Hegseth","normalized":"Pete Hegseth","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pete Hegseth</span>"},"pageid":34076202,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Pete_Hegseth_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg/320px-Pete_Hegseth_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg","width":320,"height":431},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Pete_Hegseth_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg","width":1355,"height":1824},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1271451480","tid":"acc12631-d9ff-11ef-b1b0-0d1dc9ec3aba","timestamp":"2025-01-24T03:02:41Z","description":"American political commentator (born 1980 or 1981)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Hegseth","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Hegseth?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Hegseth?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pete_Hegseth"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Hegseth","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Pete_Hegseth","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Hegseth?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pete_Hegseth"}},"extract":"Peter Brian Hegseth is an American television presenter, author, and Army veteran who is the current nominee for United States secretary of defense in President Donald Trump's second cabinet.","extract_html":"<p><b>Peter Brian Hegseth</b> is an American television presenter, author, and Army veteran who is the current nominee for United States secretary of defense in President Donald Trump's second cabinet.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Pete Hegseth"},{"views":73159,"rank":50,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-01-19Z","views":39043},{"date":"2025-01-20Z","views":12824},{"date":"2025-01-21Z","views":30019},{"date":"2025-01-22Z","views":92642},{"date":"2025-01-23Z","views":73159}],"type":"standard","title":"Aaron_Glenn","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Aaron Glenn</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q4662043","titles":{"canonical":"Aaron_Glenn","normalized":"Aaron Glenn","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Aaron Glenn</span>"},"pageid":1819271,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1271284613","tid":"645b321b-d971-11ef-a1b8-1e2f15c5ad24","timestamp":"2025-01-23T10:04:11Z","description":"American football player, coach, and administrator (born 1972)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Glenn","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Glenn?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Glenn?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Aaron_Glenn"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Glenn","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Aaron_Glenn","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Glenn?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Aaron_Glenn"}},"extract":"Aaron Devone Glenn is an American professional football coach and former cornerback who is the head coach for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL).
