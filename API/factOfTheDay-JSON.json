Notably, racial segregation in the United States was the legally and/or socially enforced separation of African Americans from whites, as well as the separation of other ethnic minorities from majority communities. While mainly referring to the physical separation and provision of separate facilities, it can also refer to other manifestations such as prohibitions against interracial marriage, and the separation of roles within an institution. The U.S. Armed Forces were formally segregated until 1948, as black units were separated from white units but were still typically led by white officers.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Racial segregation in the United States"}],"year":1947},{"text":"The Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornadoes killed 181 people and injured 970 others in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"1947_Glazier–Higgins–Woodward_tornado_outbreak","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">1947 Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornado outbreak</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q16153271","titles":{"canonical":"1947_Glazier–Higgins–Woodward_tornado_outbreak","normalized":"1947 Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornado outbreak","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">1947 Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornado outbreak</span>"},"pageid":447438,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/The_only_house_left_standing_at_Glazier%2C_TX.png/320px-The_only_house_left_standing_at_Glazier%2C_TX.png","width":320,"height":196},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/The_only_house_left_standing_at_Glazier%2C_TX.png","width":712,"height":437},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1276160968","tid":"e08b2e0e-ecf9-11ef-917c-3f60cdf0e462","timestamp":"2025-02-17T06:39:03Z","description":"1947 windstorm through the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_Glazier%E2%80%93Higgins%E2%80%93Woodward_tornado_outbreak","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_Glazier%E2%80%93Higgins%E2%80%93Woodward_tornado_outbreak?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_Glazier%E2%80%93Higgins%E2%80%93Woodward_tornado_outbreak?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:1947_Glazier%E2%80%93Higgins%E2%80%93Woodward_tornado_outbreak"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_Glazier%E2%80%93Higgins%E2%80%93Woodward_tornado_outbreak","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/1947_Glazier%E2%80%93Higgins%E2%80%93Woodward_tornado_outbreak","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_Glazier%E2%80%93Higgins%E2%80%93Woodward_tornado_outbreak?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:1947_Glazier%E2%80%93Higgins%E2%80%93Woodward_tornado_outbreak"}},"extract":"From April 9–11, 1947, a significant tornado outbreak produced catastrophic effects over portions of the southern Great Plains, in the contiguous United States.
