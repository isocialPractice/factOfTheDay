Widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, he played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers from 1955 to 1966. Koufax was the first three-time winner of the Cy Young Award, each time winning unanimously and the only pitcher to do so when a single award was given for both the leagues; he was also named the National League Most Valuable Player in 1963. Retiring at age 30 due to chronic pain in his pitching elbow, Koufax was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972 at age 36, the youngest player ever elected.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Sandy Koufax"},{"views":160452,"rank":14,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-10-26Z","views":313056},{"date":"2025-10-27Z","views":249335},{"date":"2025-10-28Z","views":197986},{"date":"2025-10-29Z","views":177373},{"date":"2025-10-30Z","views":160452}],"type":"standard","title":"Ed_Gein","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ed Gein</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q309643","titles":{"canonical":"Ed_Gein","normalized":"Ed Gein","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ed Gein</span>"},"pageid":71376,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Ed-Gein.jpeg/330px-Ed-Gein.jpeg","width":320,"height":433},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Ed-Gein.jpeg","width":409,"height":554},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1319660172","tid":"e74c8efb-b609-11f0-ab5e-397575b96baf","timestamp":"2025-10-31T03:30:10Z","description":"American murderer and body snatcher (1906–1984)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Gein","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Gein?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Gein?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ed_Gein"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Gein","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Ed_Gein","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Gein?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ed_Gein"}},"extract":"Edward Theodore Gein, also known as the Butcher of Plainfield and the Plainfield Ghoul, was an American murderer, serial killer, and body snatcher.

On 31 October 1917, infantry from the 60th (London) and the 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions of the XX Corps from the southwest conducted limited attacks in the morning, then the Anzac Mounted Division launched a series of attacks against the strong defences, which dominated the eastern side of Beersheba, resulting in their capture during the late afternoon. Shortly afterwards, the Australian Mounted Division's 4th and 12th light horse regiments conducted a mounted infantry charge with bayonets in their hands, their only weapon for mounted attack, as their rifles were slung across their backs. Part of the two regiments dismounted to attack entrenchments on Tel es Saba defending Beersheba.

Particularly during the period from AD 395 to 476, there were separate, coequal courts dividing the governance of the empire into the Western provinces and the Eastern provinces with a distinct imperial succession in the separate courts. The terms Western Roman Empire and Eastern Roman Empire were coined in modern times to describe political entities that were de facto independent; contemporary Romans did not consider the Empire to have been split into two empires but viewed it as a single polity governed by two imperial courts for administrative expediency.
