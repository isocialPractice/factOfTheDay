Designed as an air superiority day fighter, it evolved into a successful all-weather multirole aircraft. Over 4,600 aircraft have been built since production was approved in 1976. Although no longer being purchased by the U.S. Air Force, improved versions are being built for export customers. In 1993, General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation, which in turn became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger with Martin Marietta.</p>","normalizedtitle":"General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"},{"type":"standard","title":"Roboski_massacre","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Roboski massacre</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3671565","titles":{"canonical":"Roboski_massacre","normalized":"Roboski massacre","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Roboski massacre</span>"},"pageid":34236591,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Komkujiya_robosk%C3%AE.jpg/320px-Komkujiya_robosk%C3%AE.jpg","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Komkujiya_robosk%C3%AE.jpg","width":1025,"height":683},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1185272796","tid":"d313ff70-a4f5-11ee-9697-cd9c552154ab","timestamp":"2023-11-15T17:58:48Z","description":"Airstrike on Kurdish smugglers near the Turkish-Iraqi border","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboski_massacre","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboski_massacre?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboski_massacre?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Roboski_massacre"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboski_massacre","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Roboski_massacre","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboski_massacre?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Roboski_massacre"}},"extract":"The Roboski Incident, also known as the Uludere airstrike, took place on December 28, 2011, at Ortasu, Uludere near the Iraq-Turkey border, when the Turkish Air Force bombed a group of Kurdish civilians who had been involved in smuggling gasoline and cigarettes, killing 34.
