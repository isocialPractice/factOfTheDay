The modern national celebration dates to 1863; prior to this, it was a regional holiday, whose origins lie in the 17th and 18th century days of thanksgiving of Calvinist New England. The evolution of the holiday was not linear ; the first known civil day of thanksgiving in the New England tradition was declared at Plymouth Colony in 1623, two years after the famous 1621 harvest celebration popularized as the \"first Thanksgiving\" bearing a substantial, if a coincidental, similarity to what Thanksgiving Day would eventually become. Celebrations of Thanksgiving for the harvest in New England became a regular occurrence by the 1660s.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Thanksgiving (United States)"},{"views":88222,"rank":33,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-11-23Z","views":1649},{"date":"2025-11-24Z","views":1981},{"date":"2025-11-25Z","views":1616},{"date":"2025-11-26Z","views":1865},{"date":"2025-11-27Z","views":88222}],"type":"standard","title":"Debbie_Gibson","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Debbie Gibson</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q233817","titles":{"canonical":"Debbie_Gibson","normalized":"Debbie Gibson","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Debbie Gibson</span>"},"pageid":155723,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Debbie_Gibson_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/330px-Debbie_Gibson_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg","width":320,"height":358},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Debbie_Gibson_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg","width":3032,"height":3392},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1323943352","tid":"103c1699-c95d-11f0-a3d1-11aef70b04b1","timestamp":"2025-11-24T17:43:19Z","description":"American singer, songwriter, and actress (born 1970)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Gibson","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Gibson?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Gibson?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Debbie_Gibson"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Gibson","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Debbie_Gibson","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Gibson?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Debbie_Gibson"}},"extract":"Deborah Ann Gibson is an American singer, songwriter, and actress.
