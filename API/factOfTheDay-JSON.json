Known as the <b>Lubbock tornado</b>, it was in its time the costliest tornado in U.S. history, damaging nearly 9,000 homes and inflicting widespread damage to businesses, high-rise buildings, and public infrastructure. The tornado's damage was surveyed by meteorologist Ted Fujita in what researcher Thomas P. Grazulis described as \"the most detailed mapping ever done, up to that time, of the path of a single tornado.\" Originally, the most severe damage was assigned a preliminary F6 rating on the Fujita scale, making it one of only two tornadoes to receive the rating, alongside the 1974 Xenia tornado. Later, it was downgraded to an F5 rating. The extremity of the damage and the force required to displace heavy objects as much as was observed indicated that winds produced by vortices within the tornado may have exceeded 290 mph (470 km/h).</p>","normalizedtitle":"Lubbock tornado"}],"year":1970},{"text":"African Americans rioted in Birmingham, Alabama, in response to two bombings, perceiving local police to be complicit with the perpetrators.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Birmingham_riot_of_1963","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Birmingham riot of 1963</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q16823304","titles":{"canonical":"Birmingham_riot_of_1963","normalized":"Birmingham riot of 1963","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Birmingham riot of 1963</span>"},"pageid":39351591,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1284670067","tid":"1e781a3f-14dd-11f0-81d1-a9684ff07367","timestamp":"2025-04-09T00:53:58Z","description":"1963 unrest following the targeted bombings of Civil Rights leaders in Birmingham, AL, US","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_riot_of_1963","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_riot_of_1963?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_riot_of_1963?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Birmingham_riot_of_1963"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_riot_of_1963","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Birmingham_riot_of_1963","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_riot_of_1963?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Birmingham_riot_of_1963"}},"extract":"The Birmingham riot of 1963 was a civil disorder and riot in Birmingham, Alabama, that was provoked by bombings on the night of May 11, 1963.
