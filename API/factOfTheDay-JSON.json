The SBS can trace its origins back to the Second World War when the Army Special Boat Section was formed in 1940. After the Second World War, the Royal Navy formed special forces with several name changes—Special Boat Company was adopted in 1951 and re-designated as the Special Boat Squadron in 1974—until on 28 July 1987 when the unit was renamed as the Special Boat Service after assuming responsibility for maritime counter-terrorism. Most of the operations conducted by the SBS are highly classified, and are rarely commented on by the British government or the Ministry of Defence, owing to their sensitive nature.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Special Boat Service"},{"type":"standard","title":"Raid_on_Santorini","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Raid on Santorini</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q20981909","titles":{"canonical":"Raid_on_Santorini","normalized":"Raid on Santorini","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Raid on Santorini</span>"},"pageid":47775417,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/2011_Dimos_Thiras.png/330px-2011_Dimos_Thiras.png","width":320,"height":200},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/2011_Dimos_Thiras.png","width":2000,"height":1253},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1284468995","tid":"045c30c3-13e7-11f0-8fa0-ba1e73d9e6e1","timestamp":"2025-04-07T19:32:18Z","description":"1944 battle of World War II","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":36.42,"lon":25.43166667},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Santorini","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Santorini?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Santorini?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Raid_on_Santorini"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Santorini","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Raid_on_Santorini","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Santorini?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Raid_on_Santorini"}},"extract":"The Raid on Santorini took place on 24 April 1944 as part of the Mediterranean Campaign in World War II.

In it, the Military Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, writing in English as the \"Provisional Government of the Irish Republic,\" proclaimed Ireland's independence from the United Kingdom. The reading of the proclamation by Patrick Pearse outside the General Post Office (GPO) on Sackville Street, Dublin's main thoroughfare, marked the beginning of the Rising. The proclamation was modelled on a similar independence proclamation issued during the 1803 rebellion by Robert Emmet.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Proclamation of the Irish Republic"},{"type":"standard","title":"Irish_Republic","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Irish Republic</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1140152","titles":{"canonical":"Irish_Republic","normalized":"Irish Republic","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Irish Republic</span>"},"pageid":152568,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/330px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png","width":320,"height":160},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/1200px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png","width":1200,"height":600},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1285216059","tid":"52796403-178d-11f0-b358-89601d76ffb8","timestamp":"2025-04-12T11:00:19Z","description":"Irish state that declared its independence from the United Kingdom (1916, 1919–1922)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republic","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republic?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republic?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Irish_Republic"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republic","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Irish_Republic","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republic?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Irish_Republic"}},"extract":"The Irish Republic was a revolutionary state that declared its independence from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in January 1919.
