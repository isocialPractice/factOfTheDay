While Jacopo Peri's <i>Dafne</i> is generally recognised as the first work in the opera genre, and the earliest surviving opera is Peri's <i>Euridice</i>, <i>L'Orfeo</i> is the earliest that is still regularly performed.</p>","normalizedtitle":"L'Orfeo"},{"type":"standard","title":"Opera","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Opera</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1344","titles":{"canonical":"Opera","normalized":"Opera","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Opera</span>"},"pageid":22348,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Macbeth_applause_at_Savonlinna_Opera_festival_in_2007_-_panoramio.jpg/320px-Macbeth_applause_at_Savonlinna_Opera_festival_in_2007_-_panoramio.jpg","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Macbeth_applause_at_Savonlinna_Opera_festival_in_2007_-_panoramio.jpg","width":1600,"height":1200},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1276416611","tid":"dbc6a5ba-ee2b-11ef-aa35-3f2d56c676cc","timestamp":"2025-02-18T19:09:21Z","description":"Art form combining sung text and musical score in a theatrical setting","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Opera"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Opera","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Opera"}},"extract":"Opera is a form of Western theatre in which music is a fundamental component and dramatic roles are taken by singers.
