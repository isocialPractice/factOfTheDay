Burma's successful defense laid the foundation for the present-day boundary between the two countries.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Sino-Burmese War"}],"year":1769},{"text":"An earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 7.9 struck the eastern Alborz mountains in Persia, causing an estimated 200,000 deaths.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"856_Damghan_earthquake","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">856 Damghan earthquake</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3544130","titles":{"canonical":"856_Damghan_earthquake","normalized":"856 Damghan earthquake","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">856 Damghan earthquake</span>"},"pageid":23555304,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/856_Damghan_setting.png/320px-856_Damghan_setting.png","width":320,"height":233},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/856_Damghan_setting.png","width":2003,"height":1456},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1264497393","tid":"0e6d37ec-c029-11ef-a38e-4ae8c3911595","timestamp":"2024-12-22T05:53:24Z","description":"Earthquake in Iran","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":36.2,"lon":54.3},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/856_Damghan_earthquake","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/856_Damghan_earthquake?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/856_Damghan_earthquake?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:856_Damghan_earthquake"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/856_Damghan_earthquake","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/856_Damghan_earthquake","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/856_Damghan_earthquake?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:856_Damghan_earthquake"}},"extract":"The 856 Damghan earthquake or the 856 Qumis earthquake occurred on 22 December 856.
