Not outlined in any constitutional document, the office exists only per long-established convention. Under the Westminster system, the prime minister governs with the confidence of a majority of the elected House of Commons; as such, the prime minister typically sits as a member of Parliament (MP) and leads the largest party or a coalition of parties. The prime minister is appointed by the monarch's representative, the governor general, and, as first minister, selects other ministers to form the Cabinet and chairs it. Constitutionally, executive authority is vested in the monarch, but, in practice, the powers of the monarch and governor general are nearly always exercised on the advice of the Cabinet, which is collectively responsible to the House of Commons.

Although overshadowed in terms of prestige by Robert Falcon Scott's concurrent Discovery Expedition, the SNAE completed a full programme of exploration and scientific work. Its achievements included the establishment of a staffed meteorological station, the first in Antarctic territory, and the discovery of new land to the east of the Weddell Sea. Its large collection of biological and geological specimens, together with those from Bruce's earlier travels, led to the establishment of the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory in 1906.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Scottish National Antarctic Expedition"},{"type":"standard","title":"William_Speirs_Bruce","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">William Speirs Bruce</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q403186","titles":{"canonical":"William_Speirs_Bruce","normalized":"William Speirs Bruce","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">William Speirs Bruce</span>"},"pageid":816344,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/WilliamBruce.jpg/320px-WilliamBruce.jpg","width":320,"height":427},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/WilliamBruce.jpg","width":829,"height":1105},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1190109724","tid":"80e158c0-d8bb-11ee-833c-21324d2f451a","timestamp":"2023-12-16T00:32:54Z","description":"Scottish marine biologist and polar explorer","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Speirs_Bruce","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Speirs_Bruce?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Speirs_Bruce?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:William_Speirs_Bruce"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Speirs_Bruce","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/William_Speirs_Bruce","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Speirs_Bruce?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:William_Speirs_Bruce"}},"extract":"William Speirs Bruce was a British naturalist, polar scientist and oceanographer who organized and led the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition to the South Orkney Islands and the Weddell Sea.
