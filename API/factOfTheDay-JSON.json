In 751 the Merovingian dynasty which had ruled the Franks was overthrown with the consent of the Papacy and the aristocracy, and Pepin the Short, son of Martel, was crowned king of the Franks. The Carolingian dynasty reached its peak in 800 with the crowning of Charlemagne as the first emperor of the Romans in the West in over three centuries. Charlemagne's death in 814 began an extended period of fragmentation of the Carolingian Empire and decline that would eventually lead to the evolution of the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Carolingian dynasty"},{"type":"standard","title":"Berengar_I_of_Italy","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Berengar I of Italy</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q274606","titles":{"canonical":"Berengar_I_of_Italy","normalized":"Berengar I of Italy","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Berengar I of Italy</span>"},"pageid":1467835,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Berengar_I_on_a_seal.jpg/330px-Berengar_I_on_a_seal.jpg","width":320,"height":315},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Berengar_I_on_a_seal.jpg","width":890,"height":875},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1297729570","tid":"69fedae8-53d3-11f0-8b1a-904520bb4dea","timestamp":"2025-06-28T03:53:13Z","description":"Holy Roman Emperor from 915 to 924","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berengar_I_of_Italy","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berengar_I_of_Italy?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berengar_I_of_Italy?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Berengar_I_of_Italy"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berengar_I_of_Italy","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Berengar_I_of_Italy","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berengar_I_of_Italy?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Berengar_I_of_Italy"}},"extract":"Berengar I was the king of Italy from 887 and emperor between 915 and his death in 924.
