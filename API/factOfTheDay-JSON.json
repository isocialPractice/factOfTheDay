The expedition came too late and with insufficient force to prevent the fall of Serbia and was complicated by the internal political crisis in Greece. Eventually, a stable front was established, running from the Albanian Adriatic coast to the Struma River, pitting a multinational Allied force against the Bulgarian army, which was at various times bolstered with smaller units from the other Central Powers.

It is considered an important step towards the Act of Independence of Lithuania, adopted on February 16, 1918, by the Council of Lithuania, as the Seimas laid the groundwork for the establishment of an independent Lithuanian state.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Great Seimas of Vilnius"},{"type":"standard","title":"Russian_Empire","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Russian Empire</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q34266","titles":{"canonical":"Russian_Empire","normalized":"Russian Empire","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Russian Empire</span>"},"pageid":20611504,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg/330px-Flag_of_Russia.svg.png","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg/900px-Flag_of_Russia.svg.png","width":900,"height":600},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1325599015","tid":"4475ad8f-d0ac-11f0-9ad7-29a39b60395a","timestamp":"2025-12-04T00:57:55Z","description":"Eurasian empire (1721–1917)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Russian_Empire"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Russian_Empire","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Russian_Empire"}},"extract":"The Russian Empire was an empire that spanned most of northern Eurasia from its establishment in November 1721 until the proclamation of the Russian Republic in September 1917.
