The United States Army considers itself a continuation of the Continental Army, and thus considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775.</p>","normalizedtitle":"United States Army"},{"type":"standard","title":"Nidal_Hasan","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Nidal Hasan</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1400551","titles":{"canonical":"Nidal_Hasan","normalized":"Nidal Hasan","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Nidal Hasan</span>"},"pageid":24979391,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Hasan_nidal.jpg","width":240,"height":300},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Hasan_nidal.jpg","width":240,"height":300},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1254187747","tid":"968c2953-9634-11ef-910b-f96a71eb15a2","timestamp":"2024-10-29T20:30:08Z","description":"American mass murderer and former U.S. Army officer","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidal_Hasan","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidal_Hasan?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidal_Hasan?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nidal_Hasan"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidal_Hasan","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Nidal_Hasan","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidal_Hasan?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nidal_Hasan"}},"extract":"Nidal Malik Hasan is an American former United States Army major, physician and mass murderer convicted of killing 13 people and injuring more than 30 others in the Fort Hood mass shooting on November 5, 2009.
