To maintain historical accuracy, the film's material is exclusively taken from the testimonies of the platoon members, and is presented in real time beginning from the main title. It stars an ensemble cast that includes D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai as Mendoza alongside Will Poulter, Cosmo Jarvis, Kit Connor, Finn Bennett, Joseph Quinn, Charles Melton, Noah Centineo, and Michael Gandolfini. The film is dedicated to platoon member Elliott Miller, played by Jarvis, who lost his leg and voice in the incident.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Warfare (film)"},{"views":56261,"rank":41,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-04-13Z","views":15090},{"date":"2025-04-14Z","views":116758},{"date":"2025-04-15Z","views":88824},{"date":"2025-04-16Z","views":110355},{"date":"2025-04-17Z","views":56261}],"type":"standard","title":"Katy_Perry","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Katy Perry</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q42493","titles":{"canonical":"Katy_Perry","normalized":"Katy Perry","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Katy Perry</span>"},"pageid":16477368,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/KatyPerryWestminst111224_%2881_of_95%29_%2854206733094%29_%28cropped_2%29.jpg/330px-KatyPerryWestminst111224_%2881_of_95%29_%2854206733094%29_%28cropped_2%29.jpg","width":320,"height":465},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/KatyPerryWestminst111224_%2881_of_95%29_%2854206733094%29_%28cropped_2%29.jpg","width":1622,"height":2355},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1286170112","tid":"6e0edbbe-1c10-11f0-bb9a-f3ed25f0cbe3","timestamp":"2025-04-18T04:48:54Z","description":"American singer (born 1984)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Katy_Perry"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Katy_Perry","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Katy_Perry"}},"extract":"Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson, known professionally as Katy Perry, is an American singer, songwriter, and television personality.
