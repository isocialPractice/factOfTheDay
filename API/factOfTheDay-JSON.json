The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy.

Often referred to as the \"Fall Classic\", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike. The best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920, 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff. Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. Players, coaches and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory; however, they have received other items such as pocket watches and medallions in the past. The winning team is traditionally invited to the White House to meet the President of the United States.</p>","normalizedtitle":"List of World Series champions"},{"views":90893,"rank":22,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-10-17Z","views":863298},{"date":"2024-10-18Z","views":376665},{"date":"2024-10-19Z","views":191294},{"date":"2024-10-20Z","views":122629},{"date":"2024-10-21Z","views":90893}],"type":"standard","title":"One_Direction","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">One Direction</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q146027","titles":{"canonical":"One_Direction","normalized":"One Direction","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">One Direction</span>"},"pageid":31772741,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/One_Direction_Sydney_4.jpg/320px-One_Direction_Sydney_4.jpg","width":320,"height":174},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/One_Direction_Sydney_4.jpg","width":1000,"height":545},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1252547480","tid":"4fc47636-8fef-11ef-a614-2224ec6e3df1","timestamp":"2024-10-21T20:59:07Z","description":"English-Irish boy band","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Direction","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Direction?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Direction?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:One_Direction"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Direction","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/One_Direction","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Direction?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:One_Direction"}},"extract":"One Direction, often shortened to 1D, are an English-Irish pop boy band formed in London in 2010.

This was a bluntish weapon that was perhaps intended for cutting away canvas and ropes rather than as a thrusting combat weapon. The 1845 Pattern cutlass introduced a bowl-style hand guard which provided greater protection, with a longer and more curved blade. Its sharper point made it more useful for thrusting attacks, which were now emphasised in the drill manual. The 1845 Pattern was modified several times including shortening and straightening the blades, which weakened them. The 1889 Pattern had a straight, spear-pointed blade with a hilt that curved outwards to catch and redirect an opponent's sword point. The 1900 Pattern, the last navy-issue cutlass, was similar to its predecessor with the introduction of a fuller and a hilt insert that cushioned the user's little finger. The cutlass was withdrawn from service in 1936 but remains in use for ceremonial purposes. It is thought that it was last used in combat in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion.","extract_html":"<p>Ratings of the Royal Navy have used cutlasses, short, wide bladed swords, since the early 18th century.
