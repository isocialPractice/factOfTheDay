The United States Army considers itself a continuation of the Continental Army, and thus considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775.</p>","normalizedtitle":"United States Army"},{"type":"standard","title":"Battle_of_Cherbourg","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Battle of Cherbourg</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q516202","titles":{"canonical":"Battle_of_Cherbourg","normalized":"Battle of Cherbourg","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Battle of Cherbourg</span>"},"pageid":5111566,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Cotentin_Peninsula.jpg/330px-Cotentin_Peninsula.jpg","width":320,"height":283},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Cotentin_Peninsula.jpg","width":1336,"height":1181},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1297251178","tid":"2d2eac27-5167-11f0-946a-57ce1b8cc616","timestamp":"2025-06-25T01:53:23Z","description":"1944 battle of World War II","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":49.63888889,"lon":-1.61611111},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cherbourg","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cherbourg?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cherbourg?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Cherbourg"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cherbourg","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Battle_of_Cherbourg","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cherbourg?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Cherbourg"}},"extract":"The Battle of Cherbourg was part of the Battle of Normandy during World War II.
