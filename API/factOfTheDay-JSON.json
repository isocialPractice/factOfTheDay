Like kiteboarding, snowkiting can be very hazardous and should be learned and practiced with care. Snowkiting has become more popular in places often associated with skiing and snowboarding, such as Russia, Canada, Iceland, France, Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Northern and Central United States. The sport has become more diverse as adventurers use kites to travel great distances and sports enthusiasts push the boundaries of freestyle, big air, speed and back country exploration.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Snowkiting"},{"type":"standard","title":"Pole_of_Inaccessibility_research_station","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pole of Inaccessibility research station</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1469788","titles":{"canonical":"Pole_of_Inaccessibility_research_station","normalized":"Pole of Inaccessibility research station","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pole of Inaccessibility research station</span>"},"pageid":4491383,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Southern_Pole_of_Inaccessibility_Henry_Cookson_team_n2i.jpg/330px-Southern_Pole_of_Inaccessibility_Henry_Cookson_team_n2i.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Southern_Pole_of_Inaccessibility_Henry_Cookson_team_n2i.jpg","width":1628,"height":916},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1333582872","tid":"79896540-f490-11f0-9892-a1613cb8d0d1","timestamp":"2026-01-18T17:09:40Z","description":"Antarctic research station in Kemp Land","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":-82.1117,"lon":55.0325},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_Inaccessibility_research_station","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_Inaccessibility_research_station?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_Inaccessibility_research_station?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pole_of_Inaccessibility_research_station"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_Inaccessibility_research_station","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Pole_of_Inaccessibility_research_station","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_Inaccessibility_research_station?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pole_of_Inaccessibility_research_station"}},"extract":"The Pole of Inaccessibility research station is a defunct Soviet research station in Kemp Land, Antarctica, at the southern pole of inaccessibility as defined in 1958 when the station was established.
