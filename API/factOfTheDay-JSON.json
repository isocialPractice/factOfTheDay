IS eventually split, and gained global prominence in 2014, when their militants successfully captured large territories in northwestern Iraq and eastern Syria, taking advantage of the ongoing Syrian civil war. Notorious for their perpetration of war crimes and extensive human rights violations, IS have engaged in the persecution of Christians, Mandaeans, Shia Muslims, and Sufi Sunnis, and published videos of beheadings and executions of journalists and aid workers. By the end of 2015, they ruled an area with an estimated population of 12 million people, where they enforced their extremist interpretation of Islamic law, managed an annual budget exceeding <span>US$1</span><span class=\"nowrap\"> </span>billion, and commanded more than 30,000 fighters.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Islamic State"},{"type":"standard","title":"Solingen","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Solingen</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2942","titles":{"canonical":"Solingen","normalized":"Solingen","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Solingen</span>"},"pageid":181249,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Solingen_Innenstadt_001.JPG/320px-Solingen_Innenstadt_001.JPG","width":320,"height":214},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Solingen_Innenstadt_001.JPG","width":3872,"height":2592},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1243388106","tid":"376d7b3f-681e-11ef-936a-0ecd812cac50","timestamp":"2024-09-01T04:54:06Z","description":"City in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":51.17194444,"lon":7.08472222},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solingen","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solingen?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solingen?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Solingen"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solingen","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Solingen","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solingen?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Solingen"}},"extract":"Solingen is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, 25 km east of Düsseldorf along the northern edge of the Bergisches Land, south of the Ruhr.
