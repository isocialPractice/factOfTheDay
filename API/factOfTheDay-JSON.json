Currently, NASA supports the International Space Station (ISS) along with the Commercial Crew Program, and oversees the development of the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System for the lunar Artemis program.</p>","normalizedtitle":"NASA"},{"type":"standard","title":"MAVEN","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">MAVEN</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q327075","titles":{"canonical":"MAVEN","normalized":"MAVEN","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">MAVEN</span>"},"pageid":19335567,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/MAVEN_Mission_Logo.png/320px-MAVEN_Mission_Logo.png","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/MAVEN_Mission_Logo.png","width":2420,"height":2420},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1237294059","tid":"da7c2d9b-4d52-11ef-84ce-dbe3be9fc006","timestamp":"2024-07-29T02:32:52Z","description":"NASA Mars orbiter (2013–Present)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAVEN","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAVEN?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAVEN?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:MAVEN"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAVEN","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/MAVEN","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAVEN?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:MAVEN"}},"extract":"MAVEN is a NASA spacecraft orbiting Mars to study the loss of that planet's atmospheric gases to space, providing insight into the history of the planet's climate and water.
