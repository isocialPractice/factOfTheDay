Also known internationally as the <b>Northern Ireland conflict</b>, it is sometimes described as an \"irregular war\" or \"low-level war\". The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles mostly took place in Northern Ireland, at times violence spilled over into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England, and mainland Europe.</p>","normalizedtitle":"The Troubles"},{"type":"standard","title":"Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Provisional Irish Republican Army</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q504628","titles":{"canonical":"Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army","normalized":"Provisional Irish Republican Army","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Provisional Irish Republican Army</span>"},"pageid":23299,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army_Badge.svg/320px-Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army_Badge.svg.png","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army_Badge.svg/512px-Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army_Badge.svg.png","width":512,"height":512},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1225927454","tid":"616f3799-1c3e-11ef-8a15-25b0757a1d34","timestamp":"2024-05-27T15:32:52Z","description":"Paramilitary force active from 1969 to 2005","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army"}},"extract":"The Provisional Irish Republican Army, officially known as the Irish Republican Army and informally known as the Provos, was an Irish republican paramilitary force that sought to end British rule in Northern Ireland, facilitate Irish reunification and bring about an independent republic encompassing all of Ireland.
