The wars originated in political forces arising from the French Revolution (1789–1799) and from the French Revolutionary Wars (1792–1802), and produced a period of French domination over Continental Europe. The wars are categorised as seven conflicts, five named after the coalitions that fought Napoleon, plus two named for their respective theatres; the War of the Third Coalition, War of the Fourth Coalition, War of the Fifth Coalition, War of the Sixth Coalition, War of the Seventh Coalition, the Peninsular War, and the French invasion of Russia.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Napoleonic Wars"},{"type":"standard","title":"French_ship_D'Hautpoul_(1807)","displaytitle":"French ship <i>D'Hautpoul</i> (1807)","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3009029","titles":{"canonical":"French_ship_D'Hautpoul_(1807)","normalized":"French ship D'Hautpoul (1807)","display":"French ship <i>D'Hautpoul</i> (1807)"},"pageid":15397307,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Recruit_%26_D%27Haupoult.jpg/320px-Recruit_%26_D%27Haupoult.jpg","width":320,"height":212},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Recruit_%26_D%27Haupoult.jpg","width":1280,"height":846},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1219153454","tid":"e6265359-fb96-11ee-b26c-e9eb90598012","timestamp":"2024-04-16T02:13:22Z","description":"Ship of the line of the French Navy","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_ship_D'Hautpoul_(1807)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_ship_D'Hautpoul_(1807)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_ship_D'Hautpoul_(1807)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:French_ship_D'Hautpoul_(1807)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_ship_D'Hautpoul_(1807)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/French_ship_D'Hautpoul_(1807)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_ship_D'Hautpoul_(1807)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:French_ship_D'Hautpoul_(1807)"}},"extract":"D'Hautpoul was a Téméraire class 74-gun French Navy ship of the line launched at Lorient on 2 September 1807.

The recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a similar game, chaturanga, in seventh-century India. The rules of chess as they are known today emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, and is played by millions of people worldwide.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Chess"},{"type":"standard","title":"Wolfgang_von_Kempelen","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Wolfgang von Kempelen</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q252041","titles":{"canonical":"Wolfgang_von_Kempelen","normalized":"Wolfgang von Kempelen","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Wolfgang von Kempelen</span>"},"pageid":1144100,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Kempelen-charcoal.jpg/320px-Kempelen-charcoal.jpg","width":320,"height":460},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Kempelen-charcoal.jpg","width":422,"height":607},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1219340585","tid":"c2d2d933-fc76-11ee-8a80-ef7a2c8b6019","timestamp":"2024-04-17T04:55:50Z","description":"Hungarian author and inventor (1734–1804)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_von_Kempelen","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_von_Kempelen?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_von_Kempelen?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wolfgang_von_Kempelen"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_von_Kempelen","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Wolfgang_von_Kempelen","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_von_Kempelen?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wolfgang_von_Kempelen"}},"extract":"Johann Wolfgang Ritter von Kempelen de Pázmánd was a Hungarian author and inventor, known for his chess-playing \"automaton\" hoax The Turk and for his speaking machine.","extract_html":"<p><b>Johann Wolfgang Ritter von Kempelen de Pázmánd</b> was a Hungarian author and inventor, known for his chess-playing \"automaton\" hoax The Turk and for his speaking machine.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Wolfgang von Kempelen"}],"year":1783},{"text":"Lithuanian Crusade: After a month-long siege, forces of the Teutonic Order captured and destroyed Kaunas Castle (reconstruction pictured), which was defended by troops of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Lithuanian_Crusade","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Lithuanian Crusade</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q16362506","titles":{"canonical":"Lithuanian_Crusade","normalized":"Lithuanian Crusade","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Lithuanian Crusade</span>"},"pageid":50919173,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Lietuviai_kovoja_su_vokie%C4%8Diais.Lithuanians_fighting_Teutonic_Knights_%282%29.jpg/320px-Lietuviai_kovoja_su_vokie%C4%8Diais.Lithuanians_fighting_Teutonic_Knights_%282%29.jpg","width":320,"height":178},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Lietuviai_kovoja_su_vokie%C4%8Diais.Lithuanians_fighting_Teutonic_Knights_%282%29.jpg","width":607,"height":337},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1215144657","tid":"90003b5c-e908-11ee-9f5a-655cb6a4067f","timestamp":"2024-03-23T11:29:08Z","description":"13th–15th century military campaigns by the Teutonic Order","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Crusade","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Crusade?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Crusade?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lithuanian_Crusade"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Crusade","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Lithuanian_Crusade","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Crusade?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lithuanian_Crusade"}},"extract":"The Lithuanian Crusade was a series of campaigns by the Teutonic Order and the Livonian Order under the pretext of forcibly Christianizing the pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
