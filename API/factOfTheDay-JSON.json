Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> (1967). <i>The Beatles</i> is recognised for its fragmentary style and diverse range of genres, including folk, country rock, British blues, ska, music hall, proto-metal and the avant-garde. It has since been viewed by some critics as a postmodern work, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. The album was the band's first LP release on their then-recently founded Apple Records after previous albums were released on Parlophone in the United Kingdom and Capitol Records in the United States.</p>","normalizedtitle":"The Beatles (album)"}],"year":1968},{"text":"The Cambodian–Vietnamese War formally ended with the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from the People's Republic of Kampuchea, a client state it had implemented to overthrow Democratic Kampuchea and the Khmer Rouge.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Cambodian–Vietnamese_War","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Cambodian–Vietnamese War</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q635533","titles":{"canonical":"Cambodian–Vietnamese_War","normalized":"Cambodian–Vietnamese War","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Cambodian–Vietnamese War</span>"},"pageid":1708722,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5f/H_4_ill_639759_cambodia-phnom_penh-1979-61.jpg","width":300,"height":201},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5f/H_4_ill_639759_cambodia-phnom_penh-1979-61.jpg","width":300,"height":201},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1244736868","tid":"fe8b6bbe-6e2a-11ef-829d-8ea3a5cb46d2","timestamp":"2024-09-08T21:40:41Z","description":"1977–1991 conflict","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War"}},"extract":"The Cambodian–Vietnamese War was an armed conflict between Democratic Kampuchea, controlled by Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

GR indicates the four tones of Standard Chinese by varying the spelling of syllables, a method originally proposed by team member Lin Yutang (1895–1976). Distinct sets of spellings are assigned to syllables in GR according to particular rules. This differs from approaches used by other systems to denote tones, like the numerals used by the earlier Wade–Giles system, or the diacritics used by the later Hanyu Pinyin system.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Gwoyeu Romatzyh"},{"type":"standard","title":"Romanization_of_Chinese","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Romanization of Chinese</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q117073","titles":{"canonical":"Romanization_of_Chinese","normalized":"Romanization of Chinese","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Romanization of Chinese</span>"},"pageid":8710596,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Gwoyu.svg/320px-Gwoyu.svg.png","width":320,"height":660},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Gwoyu.svg/320px-Gwoyu.svg.png","width":320,"height":660},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1245560772","tid":"601d4319-71fc-11ef-96a5-a952583d35fd","timestamp":"2024-09-13T18:17:03Z","description":"Writing Chinese with the Latin alphabet","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Romanization_of_Chinese"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Romanization_of_Chinese","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Romanization_of_Chinese"}},"extract":"Romanization of Chinese is the use of the Latin alphabet to transliterate Chinese.
