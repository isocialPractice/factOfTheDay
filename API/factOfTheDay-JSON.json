The case was brought to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), who decided in 1962 in favour of Cambodia. The issue became dormant over the following decades as Cambodia fell into civil war, but remained unresolved as sections of the countries' borders were never jointly demarcated. The dispute erupted into open conflict in 2008, following Cambodia's nomination of the temple as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Thai protesters attacking their government over the issue. The clashes led to a request for clarification from the ICJ, which was decided in 2013. During this round of conflict, disputes also arose over other overlapping border areas, including those around the ancient Khmer temples of Prasat Ta Muen Thom and Prasat Ta Krabey. The conflict subsided for over a decade until it erupted again in 2025, with the worst fighting since the dispute began.","extract_html":"<p>The <b>Cambodian–Thai border dispute</b> is a long-standing territorial dispute between Cambodia and Thailand over certain areas of their shared border. It began in the 1950s, shortly after Cambodia's independence from France, and first centred on ownership of the temple of Preah Vihear. The case was brought to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), who decided in 1962 in favour of Cambodia. The issue became dormant over the following decades as Cambodia fell into civil war, but remained unresolved as sections of the countries' borders were never jointly demarcated. The dispute erupted into open conflict in 2008, following Cambodia's nomination of the temple as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Thai protesters attacking their government over the issue. The clashes led to a request for clarification from the ICJ, which was decided in 2013. During this round of conflict, disputes also arose over other overlapping border areas, including those around the ancient Khmer temples of Prasat Ta Muen Thom and Prasat Ta Krabey. The conflict subsided for over a decade until it erupted again in 2025, with the worst fighting since the dispute began.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Cambodian–Thai border dispute"}],"story":"<!--Jul 24--><b id=\"mwGg\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./2025_Cambodia–Thailand_border_conflict\" title=\"2025 Cambodia–Thailand border conflict\" id=\"mwGw\">Armed clashes erupt</a></b> on the <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Cambodia–Thailand_border\" title=\"Cambodia–Thailand border\" id=\"mwHA\">Cambodia–Thailand border</a>, amid <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Cambodian–Thai_border_dispute\" title=\"Cambodian–Thai border dispute\" id=\"mwHQ\">an ongoing dispute</a>."}],"onthisday":[{"text":"An estimated worldwide television audience of 750 million watched the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer (combined coat of arms pictured) at St Paul's Cathedral in London.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Wedding_of_Prince_Charles_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1094155","titles":{"canonical":"Wedding_of_Prince_Charles_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer","normalized":"Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer</span>"},"pageid":24332533,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/Wedding_of_Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales%2C_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer_photo.PNG/330px-Wedding_of_Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales%2C_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer_photo.PNG","width":320,"height":218},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e9/Wedding_of_Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales%2C_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer_photo.PNG","width":387,"height":264},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1303116277","tid":"03224d7a-6c39-11f0-8333-2c5b0ecabea9","timestamp":"2025-07-29T05:00:57Z","description":"1981 British royal wedding","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Prince_Charles_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Prince_Charles_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Prince_Charles_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wedding_of_Prince_Charles_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Prince_Charles_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Wedding_of_Prince_Charles_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Prince_Charles_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wedding_of_Prince_Charles_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer"}},"extract":"The wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer took place on Wednesday, 29 July 1981, at St Paul's Cathedral in London, England.
