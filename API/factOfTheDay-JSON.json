Executive authority of Singapore is vested in the President but exercised on the advice of the Cabinet led by the Prime Minister. The President, acting as the Head of State, may only act in their discretion in appointing the Prime Minister, acting as the Head of Government; as well as withholding consent for the dissolution of Parliament; along with performing key checks on the Government in addition to the ceremonial duties of the Head of State inherited from the Westminster system. The Cabinet, consisting of the Prime Minister and ministers appointed by the President on the Prime Minister's advice, is responsible for heading the Executive through ministries and other statutory boards. At the end of the term or at any time during the term, once the President has consented to a request made by the Prime Minister to dissolve Parliament, Parliamentary General Elections are held to elect members of Parliament for a new term. The President, in their discretion, then appoints a Prime Minister who is a member of Parliament representing any political party or coalition of political parties who in their judgement is likely to command the confidence of the majority of the members of Parliament. The Prime Minister then forms the Government and, along with the Cabinet, sets the general direction and control of the Government for the next term.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Government of Singapore"},{"type":"standard","title":"East_India_Company","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">East India Company</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q83164","titles":{"canonical":"East_India_Company","normalized":"East India Company","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">East India Company</span>"},"pageid":43281,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Flag_of_the_British_East_India_Company_%281801%29.svg/320px-Flag_of_the_British_East_India_Company_%281801%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":192},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Flag_of_the_British_East_India_Company_%281801%29.svg/1000px-Flag_of_the_British_East_India_Company_%281801%29.svg.png","width":1000,"height":600},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1257394338","tid":"8a9a881d-a2b3-11ef-9db3-7afecd0ddb32","timestamp":"2024-11-14T18:09:08Z","description":"British trading company (1600–1874)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:East_India_Company"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/East_India_Company","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:East_India_Company"}},"extract":"The East India Company (EIC) (1600–1874) was an English, and later British, joint-stock company founded in 1600 and dissolved in 1874.
