Their numbers were boosted by the addition to their fleet of two more ships, one of which was commanded by Stede Bonnet, but Hornigold retired from piracy toward the end of 1717, taking two vessels with him.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Blackbeard"},{"type":"standard","title":"Province_of_North_Carolina","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Province of North Carolina</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2334526","titles":{"canonical":"Province_of_North_Carolina","normalized":"Province of North Carolina","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Province of North Carolina</span>"},"pageid":491056,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Red_ensign_of_Great_Britain_%281707%E2%80%931800%2C_square_canton%29.svg/330px-Red_ensign_of_Great_Britain_%281707%E2%80%931800%2C_square_canton%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Red_ensign_of_Great_Britain_%281707%E2%80%931800%2C_square_canton%29.svg/1458px-Red_ensign_of_Great_Britain_%281707%E2%80%931800%2C_square_canton%29.svg.png","width":1458,"height":972},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1322891548","tid":"f3956f8b-c480-11f0-98ef-8f0b6503da0e","timestamp":"2025-11-18T13:17:37Z","description":"Former British province in North America","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":35.75,"lon":-83},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_North_Carolina","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_North_Carolina?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_North_Carolina?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Province_of_North_Carolina"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_North_Carolina","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Province_of_North_Carolina","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_North_Carolina?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Province_of_North_Carolina"}},"extract":"The Province of North Carolina, originally known as the Albemarle Settlements, was a proprietary colony and later royal colony of Great Britain that existed in North America from 1712 to 1776.(p. 80) It was one of the five Southern colonies and one of the thirteen American colonies.
