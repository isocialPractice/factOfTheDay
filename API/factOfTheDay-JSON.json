The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Basketball"},{"type":"standard","title":"Florida_Gators_men's_basketball","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Florida Gators men&#039;s basketball</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q5461408","titles":{"canonical":"Florida_Gators_men's_basketball","normalized":"Florida Gators men's basketball","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Florida Gators men&#039;s basketball</span>"},"pageid":10244706,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Florida_Gators_men%27s_basketball_logo.svg/320px-Florida_Gators_men%27s_basketball_logo.svg.png","width":320,"height":223},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Florida_Gators_men%27s_basketball_logo.svg/195px-Florida_Gators_men%27s_basketball_logo.svg.png","width":195,"height":136},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1285000643","tid":"3fc049cb-1676-11f0-9a10-3acf0e009f52","timestamp":"2025-04-11T01:42:38Z","description":"Team representing the Florida State University in basketball","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators_men's_basketball","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators_men's_basketball?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators_men's_basketball?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Florida_Gators_men's_basketball"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators_men's_basketball","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Florida_Gators_men's_basketball","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators_men's_basketball?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Florida_Gators_men's_basketball"}},"extract":"The Florida Gators men's basketball team represents the University of Florida in the sport of basketball.

Invasions were also launched into the Caucasus against the Kingdom of Georgia, the Chechens, the Ingush, and Circassia though they failed to fully subjugate the latter. More invasions were launched in Southeast Europe against Bulgaria, Croatia, and the Latin Empire. The operations were planned by General Subutai (1175–1248) and commanded by Batu Khan and Kadan, two grandsons of Genghis Khan. Their conquests integrated much of Eastern European territory into the empire of the Golden Horde.

Following this, they began their invasion into Central Europe by launching a two-pronged invasion of then-fragmented Poland, culminating in the Battle of Legnica, and the Kingdom of Hungary, culminating in the Battle of Mohi. Invasions were also launched into the Caucasus against the Kingdom of Georgia, the Chechens, the Ingush, and Circassia though they failed to fully subjugate the latter. More invasions were launched in Southeast Europe against Bulgaria, Croatia, and the Latin Empire. The operations were planned by General Subutai (1175–1248) and commanded by Batu Khan and Kadan, two grandsons of Genghis Khan. Their conquests integrated much of Eastern European territory into the empire of the Golden Horde.
