Initially formed from domain armies after the Meiji Restoration, it evolved into a powerful modern military influenced by French and German models. The IJA was responsible for several overseas military campaigns, including the invasion of Manchuria, involvement in the Boxer Rebellion, and fighting across the Asia-Pacific during the Pacific War. Notorious for committing widespread war crimes, the army was dissolved after Japan's surrender in 1945, and its functions were succeeded by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Imperial Japanese Army"},{"type":"standard","title":"Battle_of_Pasir_Panjang","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Battle of Pasir Panjang</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q4208426","titles":{"canonical":"Battle_of_Pasir_Panjang","normalized":"Battle of Pasir Panjang","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Battle of Pasir Panjang</span>"},"pageid":1849433,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Pasir_Panjang_Machine-Gun_Pillbox_8%2C_Nov_06.JPG/330px-Pasir_Panjang_Machine-Gun_Pillbox_8%2C_Nov_06.JPG","width":330,"height":248},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Pasir_Panjang_Machine-Gun_Pillbox_8%2C_Nov_06.JPG","width":1600,"height":1200},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1334689682","tid":"9e03a4cd-f994-11f0-b602-060a2229eb17","timestamp":"2026-01-25T02:21:55Z","description":"1942 battle of the Japanese invasion of Singapore during WWII","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":1.28333333,"lon":103.76666667},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pasir_Panjang","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pasir_Panjang?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pasir_Panjang?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Pasir_Panjang"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pasir_Panjang","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Battle_of_Pasir_Panjang","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pasir_Panjang?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Pasir_Panjang"}},"extract":"The Battle of Pasir Panjang, which took place between 13 and 15 February 1942, was part of the final stage of the Empire of Japan's invasion of Singapore during World War II.

From the 8th century until 1870, the pope was the sovereign or head of state of the Papal States, and since 1929 of the much smaller Vatican City State. From a Catholic viewpoint, the primacy of the bishop of Rome is largely derived from his role as the apostolic successor to Saint Peter, to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus, who gave Peter the Keys of Heaven and the powers of \"binding and loosing\", naming him as the \"rock\" upon which the Church would be built. The current pope is Leo XIV, who was elected on 8 May 2025 on the second day of the 2025 papal conclave.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Pope"},{"type":"standard","title":"Pope_Alexander_VIII","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pope Alexander VIII</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q101294","titles":{"canonical":"Pope_Alexander_VIII","normalized":"Pope Alexander VIII","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pope Alexander VIII</span>"},"pageid":23790,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Portrait_of_Pope_Alexander_VIII_%E2%80%93_Roman_School_of_17th_Century_%E2%80%93_%28unframed%29.jpg/330px-Portrait_of_Pope_Alexander_VIII_%E2%80%93_Roman_School_of_17th_Century_%E2%80%93_%28unframed%29.jpg","width":330,"height":447},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Portrait_of_Pope_Alexander_VIII_%E2%80%93_Roman_School_of_17th_Century_%E2%80%93_%28unframed%29.jpg","width":583,"height":789},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1325937921","tid":"5e98c286-d249-11f0-8ca1-5f2703f7b47e","timestamp":"2025-12-06T02:15:01Z","description":"Head of the Catholic Church from 1689 to 1691","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VIII","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VIII?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VIII?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pope_Alexander_VIII"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VIII","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Pope_Alexander_VIII","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VIII?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pope_Alexander_VIII"}},"extract":"Pope Alexander VIII, born Pietro Vito Ottoboni, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 6 October 1689 to his death in February 1691.
