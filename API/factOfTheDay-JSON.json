Based on the book series of the same name by Julia Quinn, it is Shondaland's first scripted show for Netflix. It follows the close-knit siblings of the noble and influential Bridgerton family as they navigate the highly competitive social season, where young marriageable nobility and gentry are introduced into society. The series is set during the early 19th century in an alternative London Regency era, in which George III established racial equality and granted aristocratic titles to people of color due to the African heritage of his wife, Queen Charlotte.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Bridgerton"},{"views":144349,"rank":22,"view_history":[{"date":"2026-01-26Z","views":129280},{"date":"2026-01-27Z","views":128031},{"date":"2026-01-28Z","views":125831},{"date":"2026-01-29Z","views":126334},{"date":"2026-01-30Z","views":144349}],"type":"standard","title":"Deaths_in_2026","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Deaths in 2026</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q134185145","titles":{"canonical":"Deaths_in_2026","normalized":"Deaths in 2026","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Deaths in 2026</span>"},"pageid":81858235,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1335782106","tid":"1b7e56b0-fe62-11f0-a8e1-a0511cff75a9","timestamp":"2026-01-31T05:02:57Z","description":"","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2026","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2026?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2026?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Deaths_in_2026"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2026","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Deaths_in_2026","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2026?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Deaths_in_2026"}},"extract":"\n\n\nThe following notable deaths occurred in 2026.
