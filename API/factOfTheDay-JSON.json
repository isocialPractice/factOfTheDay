Established in 1958, it succeeded the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to give the U.S. space development effort a distinctly civilian orientation, emphasizing peaceful applications in space science. It has since led most American space exploration, including Project Mercury, Project Gemini, the 1968–1972 Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and the Space Shuttle. It currently supports the International Space Station and oversees the development of the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System for the crewed lunar Artemis program, the Commercial Crew spacecraft, and the planned Lunar Gateway space station.</p>","normalizedtitle":"NASA"},{"type":"standard","title":"NEAR_Shoemaker","displaytitle":"<i>NEAR Shoemaker</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q217188","titles":{"canonical":"NEAR_Shoemaker","normalized":"NEAR Shoemaker","display":"<i>NEAR Shoemaker</i>"},"pageid":37537,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/NEAR_Shoemaker_spacecraft_model.png/320px-NEAR_Shoemaker_spacecraft_model.png","width":320,"height":212},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/NEAR_Shoemaker_spacecraft_model.png","width":400,"height":265},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1181813244","tid":"36cd8380-c475-11ee-be22-83ba613aff56","timestamp":"2023-10-25T10:58:46Z","description":"American space probe to asteroid (1996–2001)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEAR_Shoemaker","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEAR_Shoemaker?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEAR_Shoemaker?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:NEAR_Shoemaker"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEAR_Shoemaker","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/NEAR_Shoemaker","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEAR_Shoemaker?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:NEAR_Shoemaker"}},"extract":"Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous – Shoemaker, renamed after its 1996 launch in honor of planetary scientist Eugene Shoemaker, was a robotic space probe designed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory for NASA to study the near-Earth asteroid Eros from close orbit over a period of a year.
