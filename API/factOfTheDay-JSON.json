Currently, NASA supports the International Space Station along with the Commercial Crew Program, and oversees the development of the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System for the lunar Artemis program.</p>","normalizedtitle":"NASA"},{"type":"standard","title":"Uncrewed_spacecraft","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Uncrewed spacecraft</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1528166","titles":{"canonical":"Uncrewed_spacecraft","normalized":"Uncrewed spacecraft","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Uncrewed spacecraft</span>"},"pageid":184527,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Progress_M-06M.jpg/320px-Progress_M-06M.jpg","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Progress_M-06M.jpg","width":2100,"height":1400},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1221726003","tid":"ddf833dd-07dc-11ef-a2f8-1762372e953b","timestamp":"2024-05-01T17:04:27Z","description":"Spacecraft without people on board","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Uncrewed_spacecraft"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Uncrewed_spacecraft","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Uncrewed_spacecraft"}},"extract":"Uncrewed spacecraft or robotic spacecraft are spacecraft without people on board.
