The Bill renames the Act to <b>‘United Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act, 1995’.</b> The amendment, introduces reforms that position India ahead of many Western, European, and Muslim-majority countries in Waqf management, by incorporating 25 recommendations from the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), aims for the removal of inequality, introduction of gender equality by mandating representation of at least two Muslim women on the Central Waqf Council and State Waqf Boards and ensuring female inheritance rights, and promotion of sectarian inclusivity by requiring representation from various Muslim sects on State Waqf Boards. The bill empowers the Central Government to create rules for Waqf registration, auditing, and accounts, ensuring transparency and accountability. An appeal process is also included, allowing decisions made by Waqf tribunals to be challenged in the High Court within 90 days.</p>","normalizedtitle":"The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024"},{"views":72138,"rank":30,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-03-30Z","views":84891},{"date":"2025-03-31Z","views":154206},{"date":"2025-04-01Z","views":99500},{"date":"2025-04-02Z","views":76732},{"date":"2025-04-03Z","views":72138}],"type":"standard","title":"The_White_Lotus","displaytitle":"<i>The White Lotus</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q106679014","titles":{"canonical":"The_White_Lotus","normalized":"The White Lotus","display":"<i>The White Lotus</i>"},"pageid":65625519,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1283858260","tid":"cbc2eb39-10f7-11f0-b1f4-2c81f1484344","timestamp":"2025-04-04T01:54:51Z","description":"2021 American TV series or program","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Lotus","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Lotus?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Lotus?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_White_Lotus"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Lotus","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/The_White_Lotus","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Lotus?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_White_Lotus"}},"extract":"The White Lotus is an American dark comedy drama anthology television series created by Mike White for HBO that premiered on July 11, 2021.

It stars Adam Scott, Zach Cherry, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Jen Tullock, Dichen Lachman, Michael Chernus, John Turturro, Christopher Walken, Sarah Bock and Patricia Arquette. The series follows employees at the biotechnology corporation Lumon Industries that have undergone \"severance\"—a medical procedure that ensures they retain no memories of the outside world while at work, and have no recollection of their job once they leave. This results in two distinct personalities for each employee: the \"innie\", who exists solely within Lumon, and the \"outie\", who lives their personal life outside of work.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Severance (TV series)"},{"views":59114,"rank":42,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-03-30Z","views":489},{"date":"2025-03-31Z","views":633},{"date":"2025-04-01Z","views":553},{"date":"2025-04-02Z","views":1239},{"date":"2025-04-03Z","views":59114}],"type":"standard","title":"Joe_Milton","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Joe Milton</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q99399800","titles":{"canonical":"Joe_Milton","normalized":"Joe Milton","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Joe Milton</span>"},"pageid":65334705,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Joe_Milton_Senior_Bowl.png/330px-Joe_Milton_Senior_Bowl.png","width":320,"height":446},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Joe_Milton_Senior_Bowl.png","width":742,"height":1035},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1283824807","tid":"65c46dc9-10d3-11f0-b0f1-59983f2de032","timestamp":"2025-04-03T21:34:18Z","description":"American football player (born 2000)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Joe_Milton"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Joe_Milton","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Joe_Milton"}},"extract":"Joseph Jay Milton is an American professional football quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL).

Kennel clubs became popular in the mid 19th century. All-encompassing kennel clubs are also referred to as 'all-breed clubs', although \"all\" means only those breeds that they have decided to recognize, and \"breed\" means <i>purebred</i> dogs, not including dog hybrids and crossbreeds or mixed-breed dogs. A club that handles only one breed is known as a <b>breed club</b>.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Kennel club"},{"type":"standard","title":"Sewallis_Shirley_(MP)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Sewallis Shirley (MP)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q7458155","titles":{"canonical":"Sewallis_Shirley_(MP)","normalized":"Sewallis Shirley (MP)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Sewallis Shirley (MP)</span>"},"pageid":22802325,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Sewallis_Shirley.jpg/320px-Sewallis_Shirley.jpg","width":320,"height":484},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Sewallis_Shirley.jpg","width":327,"height":495},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1242886590","tid":"dd33b98f-65e0-11ef-b1e4-6908d11063f6","timestamp":"2024-08-29T08:29:53Z","description":"British politician","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewallis_Shirley_(MP)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewallis_Shirley_(MP)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewallis_Shirley_(MP)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sewallis_Shirley_(MP)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewallis_Shirley_(MP)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Sewallis_Shirley_(MP)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewallis_Shirley_(MP)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sewallis_Shirley_(MP)"}},"extract":"Sewallis Evelyn Shirley DL, JP, was a British politician.
