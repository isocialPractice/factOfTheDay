Along with England, it is the joint oldest team in Test cricket history, playing in the first ever Test match in 1877; the team also plays One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket, participating in both the first ODI, against England in the 1970–71 season and the first T20I, against New Zealand in the 2004–05 season, winning both games. The team draws its players from teams playing in the Australian domestic competitions – the Sheffield Shield, the Australian domestic limited-overs cricket tournament and the Big Bash League. Australia are the current ICC World Test Championship and ICC Cricket World Cup champions. They are regarded as the most successful cricket team in the history of cricket.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Australia national cricket team"},{"type":"standard","title":"Ian_Craig","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ian Craig</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q5981297","titles":{"canonical":"Ian_Craig","normalized":"Ian Craig","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ian Craig</span>"},"pageid":1862185,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Ian_Craig_1960.jpg/320px-Ian_Craig_1960.jpg","width":320,"height":355},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Ian_Craig_1960.jpg","width":650,"height":721},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1251408338","tid":"fd4d0b51-8b53-11ef-9a69-cf5343df4498","timestamp":"2024-10-16T00:17:12Z","description":"Australian cricketer","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Craig","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Craig?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Craig?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ian_Craig"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Craig","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Ian_Craig","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Craig?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ian_Craig"}},"extract":"Ian David Craig was an Australian cricketer who represented the Australian national team in 11 Tests between 1953 and 1958.

In just over a decade, he created approximately 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. His oeuvre includes landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, most of which are characterised by bold colours and dramatic brushwork that contributed to the rise of expressionism in modern art. Van Gogh's work was beginning to gain critical attention before he died from a self-inflicted gunshot at age 37.
