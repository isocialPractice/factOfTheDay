It is usually considered an independent academic discipline, but may also be classified as part of anthropology, history or geography.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Archaeology"},{"type":"standard","title":"Amazon_rainforest","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Amazon rainforest</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q177567","titles":{"canonical":"Amazon_rainforest","normalized":"Amazon rainforest","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Amazon rainforest</span>"},"pageid":48139,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Amazon_rainforest_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg/320px-Amazon_rainforest_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Amazon_rainforest_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg/541px-Amazon_rainforest_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg.png","width":541,"height":541},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1195282282","tid":"5c7f5a90-b1d3-11ee-9a39-dbbcef4978ba","timestamp":"2024-01-13T05:19:36Z","description":"Large rainforest in South America","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Amazon_rainforest"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Amazon_rainforest","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Amazon_rainforest"}},"extract":"The Amazon rainforest, also called Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America.
