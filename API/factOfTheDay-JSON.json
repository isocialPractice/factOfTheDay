Produced by Jyoti Deshpande, Aditya Dhar, and Lokesh Dhar under Jio Studios and B62 Studios, it stars Ranveer Singh, Akshaye Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal, R. Madhavan, and several other actors. The first instalment of a two-part film series, it depicts an anti-terror covert operation, where an undercover agent infiltrates Karachi's criminal and political underworld in Pakistan. The plot loosely joins several real-life events involving geopolitical tensions such as the 1999 IC-814 hijacking, the 2001 Indian Parliament attack, the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and events surrounding Operation Lyari.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Dhurandhar"}]},"image":{"title":"File:Phalacrocorax carbo, Egretta garzetta and Mareca strepera in Taudha Lake.jpg","thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Phalacrocorax_carbo%2C_Egretta_garzetta_and_Mareca_strepera_in_Taudha_Lake.jpg/960px-Phalacrocorax_carbo%2C_Egretta_garzetta_and_Mareca_strepera_in_Taudha_Lake.jpg","width":640,"height":427},"image":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Phalacrocorax_carbo%2C_Egretta_garzetta_and_Mareca_strepera_in_Taudha_Lake.jpg","width":7009,"height":4673},"file_page":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phalacrocorax_carbo,_Egretta_garzetta_and_Mareca_strepera_in_Taudha_Lake.jpg","artist":{"html":"<a href=\"//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Prasan_Shrestha\" title=\"User:Prasan Shrestha\">Prasan Shrestha</a>","text":"Prasan Shrestha"},"credit":{"html":"<span class=\"int-own-work\" lang=\"en\">Own work</span>","text":"Own work"},"license":{"type":"CC BY-SA 4.0","code":"cc-by-sa-4.0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0"},"description":{"html":"<a rel=\"mw:WikiLink/Interwiki\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great%20cormorant\" title=\"en:Great cormorant\" class=\"extiw\">Great Cormorant</a> (<i>Phalacrocorax carbo</i>), <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink/Interwiki\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%20egret\" title=\"en:Little egret\" class=\"extiw\">Little Egret</a> (<i>Egretta garzetta</i>) and <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink/Interwiki\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadwall\" title=\"en:Gadwall\" class=\"extiw\">Gadwall</a> (<i>Mareca strepera</i>) in misty <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink/Interwiki\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taudaha%20Lake\" title=\"en:Taudaha Lake\" class=\"extiw\">Taudaha Lake</a> during winter, near <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink/Interwiki\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu\" title=\"en:Kathmandu\" class=\"extiw\">Kathmandu, Nepal</a>.","text":"Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), Little Egret (Egretta garzetta) and Gadwall (Mareca strepera) in misty Taudaha Lake during winter, near Kathmandu, Nepal.","lang":"en"},"wb_entity_id":"M89910053","structured":{"captions":{"en":"Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), Little Egret (Egretta garzetta) and Gadwall (Mareca strepera) in Taudaha Lake, near Katmandu, Nepal","cs":"kormorán velký, volavka stříbřitá a kopřivka obecná na jezeře Taudaha na předměstí Káthmándú v Nepálu","de":"Großer Kormoran (Phalacrocorax carbo), Kleiner Reiher (Egretta garzetta) und Schnatterente (Mareca strepera) im Taudaha-See, bei Kathmandu, Nepal","pl":"Kormoran (Phalacrocorax carbo), czapla nadobna (Egretta garzetta) i krakwa (Mareca strepera) na jeziorze Taudaha, niedaleko Katmandu, Nepal","zh":"陶达哈湖的普通鸬鹚（Phalacrocorax carbo）、白鹭（Egretta garzetta）和赤膀鸭（Mareca strepera），该湖位于尼泊尔加德满都附近","es":"Cormorán grande (Phalacrocorax carbo), garceta común (Egretta garzetta) y ánade friso (Mareca strepera) en el lago Taudaha, cerca de Katmandú, Nepal.","ckb":"دیمەنی چەند ئاژەڵێکی ئاوی جۆری \"کۆرمۆنانتی گەورە\"، لە کەشوھەوایەکی خۆڵاوی دەریاچەی تاوداها، لە نیپاڵ.","he":"קורמורן גדול (Phalacrocorax carbo), לבנית קטנה (Egretta garzetta), וברווז אפור (Mareca strepera) באגם טָאוּדַאהַא ליד קטמנדו, נפאל.","ar":"طائر الغاق الكبير (Phalacrocorax carbo)، البلشون الصغير (Egretta garzetta) و Gadwall (Mareca strepera) في بحيرة تاوداها، بالقرب من كاتماندو، نيبال","fr":"Grand cormoran (Phalacrocorax carbo), aigrette garzette (Egretta garzetta) et canard chipeau (Mareca strepera) au lac Taudaha, près de Katmandou, Népal.","hu":"Nagy kárókatona (Phalacrocorax carbo), kis kócsag (Egretta garzetta) és szürke réce (Mareca strepera) a Taudaha-tóban, Katmandu közelében, Nepálban","uk":"Баклан великий (Phalacrocorax carbo), чепура мала (Egretta garzetta) і нерозень (Mareca strepera) на озері Таудаха в Непалі.
