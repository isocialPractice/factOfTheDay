Military action is employed by the enforcing state and, depending on the terms of the NFZ, may include preemptive attacks to prevent potential violations, reactive force targeted at violating aircraft, or surveillance with no use of force. Air exclusion zones and anti-aircraft defences are sometimes set up in a civilian context, for example to protect sensitive locations, or events such as the 2012 London Olympic Games, against terrorist air attack. A no-fly zone is generally not considered a form of aerial blockade due to its more limited scope compared to an aerial blockade.</p>","normalizedtitle":"No-fly zone"},{"type":"standard","title":"United_Nations_Security_Council","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">United Nations Security Council</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q37470","titles":{"canonical":"United_Nations_Security_Council","normalized":"United Nations Security Council","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">United Nations Security Council</span>"},"pageid":31956,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Emblem_of_the_United_Nations.svg/320px-Emblem_of_the_United_Nations.svg.png","width":320,"height":273},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Emblem_of_the_United_Nations.svg/512px-Emblem_of_the_United_Nations.svg.png","width":512,"height":436},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1217323960","tid":"88774308-f304-11ee-8ee1-1308db07ba96","timestamp":"2024-04-05T04:25:29Z","description":"One of the six principal organs of the UN","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:United_Nations_Security_Council"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/United_Nations_Security_Council","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:United_Nations_Security_Council"}},"extract":"The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations (UN) and is charged with ensuring international peace and security, recommending the admission of new UN members to the General Assembly, and approving any changes to the UN Charter.

Prostheses are intended to restore the normal functions of the missing body part. Amputee rehabilitation is primarily coordinated by a physiatrist as part of an inter-disciplinary team consisting of physiatrists, prosthetists, nurses, physical therapists, and occupational therapists. Prostheses can be created by hand or with computer-aided design (CAD), a software interface that helps creators design and analyze the creation with computer-generated 2-D and 3-D graphics as well as analysis and optimization tools.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Prosthesis"},{"type":"standard","title":"Cancer_research","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Cancer research</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3421914","titles":{"canonical":"Cancer_research","normalized":"Cancer research","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Cancer research</span>"},"pageid":1334379,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1210393082","tid":"0476a975-d49a-11ee-a823-4a748120899a","timestamp":"2024-02-26T11:27:26Z","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_research","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_research?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_research?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cancer_research"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_research","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Cancer_research","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_research?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cancer_research"}},"extract":"\nCancer research is research into cancer to identify causes and develop strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and cure.","extract_html":"<p>\n<b>Cancer research</b> is research into cancer to identify causes and develop strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and cure.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Cancer research"}],"year":1980},{"text":"Aboard Vostok 1, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin performed the first human spaceflight, completing one orbit of Earth in 108 minutes.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Vostok_1","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Vostok 1</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q182524","titles":{"canonical":"Vostok_1","normalized":"Vostok 1","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Vostok 1</span>"},"pageid":32363,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b1/Vostok1.jpg","width":240,"height":180},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b1/Vostok1.jpg","width":240,"height":180},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1216856847","tid":"f133a5eb-f0e3-11ee-9b51-2219374fae4b","timestamp":"2024-04-02T11:27:09Z","description":"First human spaceflight in history","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_1","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_1?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_1?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vostok_1"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_1","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Vostok_1","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_1?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vostok_1"}},"extract":"Vostok 1 was the first spaceflight of the Vostok programme and the first human orbital spaceflight in history.
