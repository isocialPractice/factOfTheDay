In his comic book appearances, Doctor Doom is depicted as the monarch of Latveria whose goal is to bring order to humanity through world conquest. He serves as the archenemy of Reed Richards and the Fantastic Four, though he has also come into conflict with other superheroes in the Marvel Universe, including Spider-Man, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, the Black Panther, the X-Men, and the Avengers. While usually portrayed as a villain, Doom has also been an antihero at times, working with heroes if their goals align and only if it benefits him.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Doctor Doom"},{"views":84705,"rank":48,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-07-27Z","views":78805},{"date":"2024-07-28Z","views":85973},{"date":"2024-07-29Z","views":80130},{"date":"2024-07-30Z","views":85133},{"date":"2024-07-31Z","views":84705}],"type":"standard","title":"Swimming_at_the_2024_Summer_Olympics","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Swimming at the 2024 Summer Olympics</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q109317224","titles":{"canonical":"Swimming_at_the_2024_Summer_Olympics","normalized":"Swimming at the 2024 Summer Olympics","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Swimming at the 2024 Summer Olympics</span>"},"pageid":72236803,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/Swimming_%E2%80%93_Paris_2024.svg/320px-Swimming_%E2%80%93_Paris_2024.svg.png","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/Swimming_%E2%80%93_Paris_2024.svg/316px-Swimming_%E2%80%93_Paris_2024.svg.png","width":316,"height":316},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1237907229","tid":"bd915f88-4fb1-11ef-9ce7-283cd93393cb","timestamp":"2024-08-01T02:57:08Z","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_at_the_2024_Summer_Olympics","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_at_the_2024_Summer_Olympics?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_at_the_2024_Summer_Olympics?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Swimming_at_the_2024_Summer_Olympics"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_at_the_2024_Summer_Olympics","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Swimming_at_the_2024_Summer_Olympics","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_at_the_2024_Summer_Olympics?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Swimming_at_the_2024_Summer_Olympics"}},"extract":"The swimming competitions at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris are scheduled to run from 27 July to 9 August 2024.

It is the only plateau in Kerala. The Wayanad Plateau forms a continuation of the Mysore Plateau, the southern portion of Deccan Plateau. It is set high in the Western Ghats with altitudes ranging from 700 to 2,100 meters. Vellari Mala, a 2,240 m (7,349 ft) high peak situated on the trijunction of Wayanad, Malappuram, and Kozhikode districts, is the highest point in Wayanad district. The district was formed on 1 November 1980 as the 12th district in Kerala, by carving out areas from Kozhikode and Kannur districts. An area of 885.92 km<sup>2</sup> in the district is forested. Wayanad has three municipal towns—Kalpetta, Mananthavady and Sulthan Bathery. There are many indigenous tribes in this area. The Kabini River, a tributary of Kaveri River, originates at Wayanad. Wayanad district, along with the Chaliyar valley in the neighbouring Nilambur in Malappuram district, is known for natural gold fields, which are also seen in other parts of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Chaliyar river, which is the fourth longest river of Kerala, originates on the Wayanad plateau. The historically important Edakkal Caves are located in Wayanad district.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Wayanad district"}],"story":"<!--Jul 30--><b id=\"mwDQ\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./2024_Wayanad_landslides\" title=\"2024 Wayanad landslides\" id=\"mwDg\">Landslides</a></b> in <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Wayanad_district\" title=\"Wayanad district\" id=\"mwDw\">Wayanad</a>, India, kill more than 180 people."},{"links":[{"type":"standard","title":"2024_All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship_final","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">2024 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q126415690","titles":{"canonical":"2024_All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship_final","normalized":"2024 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">2024 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final</span>"},"pageid":77004280,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Sam_Maguire_Cup.jpg/320px-Sam_Maguire_Cup.jpg","width":320,"height":427},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Sam_Maguire_Cup.jpg","width":2448,"height":3264},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1237916532","tid":"094921a2-4fbc-11ef-9c4d-11f0684fe3e6","timestamp":"2024-08-01T04:10:50Z","description":"Gaelic football match","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship_final","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship_final?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship_final?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2024_All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship_final"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship_final","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/2024_All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship_final","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship_final?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2024_All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship_final"}},"extract":"The 2024 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final was the 137th final of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and the culmination of the 2024 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.

Bound together in a political union, each state holds governmental jurisdiction over a separate and defined geographic territory where it shares its sovereignty with the federal government. Due to this shared sovereignty, Americans are citizens both of the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons restricted by certain types of court orders.</p>","normalizedtitle":"U.S. state"}],"year":1876},{"text":"Three days of rioting erupted after a parade in Philadelphia, celebrating the end of slavery in the West Indies, was attacked by a mob.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Lombard_Street_riot","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Lombard Street riot</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q6669368","titles":{"canonical":"Lombard_Street_riot","normalized":"Lombard Street riot","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Lombard Street riot</span>"},"pageid":17198124,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/1846_Street_Map_or_Plan_of_Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_-_Geographicus_-_Phili-m-1846.jpg/320px-1846_Street_Map_or_Plan_of_Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_-_Geographicus_-_Phili-m-1846.jpg","width":320,"height":398},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/1846_Street_Map_or_Plan_of_Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_-_Geographicus_-_Phili-m-1846.jpg","width":2415,"height":3000},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1222514521","tid":"45c3b753-0b9d-11ef-a7ac-779072c6ad31","timestamp":"2024-05-06T11:39:18Z","description":"Racial riot in Philadelphia in 1842","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":39.943,"lon":-75.152},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_riot","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_riot?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_riot?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lombard_Street_riot"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_riot","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Lombard_Street_riot","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_riot?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lombard_Street_riot"}},"extract":"The Lombard Street riot was a three-day race riot in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1842.
