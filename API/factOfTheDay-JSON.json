This isolation also affects faunal diversity and salinity, both of which are lower than in the open ocean. The sea has no large islands, bays or capes. Its water balance is mostly determined by the inflow and outflow through the straits connecting it to the neighboring seas and the Pacific Ocean. Few rivers discharge into the sea and their total contribution to the water exchange is within 1%.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Sea of Japan"}],"year":2012},{"text":"Controversy surrounding the relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, a Soviet Red Army World War II memorial in Tallinn, Estonia, erupted into mass protests and riots.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Bronze_Soldier_of_Tallinn","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Bronze Soldier of Tallinn</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q928267","titles":{"canonical":"Bronze_Soldier_of_Tallinn","normalized":"Bronze Soldier of Tallinn","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Bronze Soldier of Tallinn</span>"},"pageid":8957317,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/2024_May_11_Bronze_Soldier_Tallinn.jpg/330px-2024_May_11_Bronze_Soldier_Tallinn.jpg","width":320,"height":185},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/2024_May_11_Bronze_Soldier_Tallinn.jpg","width":3576,"height":2072},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1286825151","tid":"cf51d222-1f43-11f0-b53d-94384799d93d","timestamp":"2025-04-22T06:34:15Z","description":"Controversial Soviet World War II memorial in Tallinn, Estonia","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":59.42166389,"lon":24.76546389},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Soldier_of_Tallinn","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Soldier_of_Tallinn?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Soldier_of_Tallinn?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bronze_Soldier_of_Tallinn"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Soldier_of_Tallinn","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Bronze_Soldier_of_Tallinn","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Soldier_of_Tallinn?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bronze_Soldier_of_Tallinn"}},"extract":"The Bronze Soldier is the informal name of a controversial Soviet World War II war memorial in Tallinn, Estonia, built at the site of several war graves, which were relocated to the nearby Tallinn Military Cemetery in 2007.

Later, as Europe reeled from the carnage of World War I and connotations of European royalty fell into disfavor, the B&amp;O discreetly omitted the sobriquet <i>Royal Blue Line</i> from its New York passenger service and the <i>Royal Blue</i> disappeared from B&amp;O timetables. Beginning in 1917, former <i>Royal Blue Line</i> trains were renamed: the <i>Royal Limited</i>, for example, became the <i>National Limited</i>, continuing west from Washington to St. Louis via Cincinnati. During the Depression, the B&amp;O hearkened back to the halcyon pre-World War I era when it launched a re-christened <i>Royal Blue</i> train between New York and Washington in 1935. The B&amp;O finally discontinued all passenger service north of Baltimore on April 26, 1958, including the <i>Royal Blue</i>.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Royal Blue (train)"},{"type":"standard","title":"Railway_electrification","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Railway electrification</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q388201","titles":{"canonical":"Railway_electrification","normalized":"Railway electrification","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Railway electrification</span>"},"pageid":558959,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Catenaire_25_kv_Caen_Paris.JPG/330px-Catenaire_25_kv_Caen_Paris.JPG","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Catenaire_25_kv_Caen_Paris.JPG","width":2048,"height":1536},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1286059583","tid":"93a8b475-1b91-11f0-b1f0-6186609f9a37","timestamp":"2025-04-17T13:40:51Z","description":"Conversion of railways to use electricity for propulsion","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_electrification","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_electrification?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_electrification?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Railway_electrification"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_electrification","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Railway_electrification","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_electrification?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Railway_electrification"}},"extract":"Railway electrification is the use of electric power for the propulsion of rail transport.
