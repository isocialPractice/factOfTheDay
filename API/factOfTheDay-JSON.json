It was also the sixth and most recent presidential election in U.S. history in which both major party candidates were registered in the same home state; the others have been in 1860, 1904, 1920, 1940, and 1944.</p>","normalizedtitle":"2016 United States presidential election"},{"views":63701,"rank":46,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-09-07Z","views":157181},{"date":"2024-09-08Z","views":93368},{"date":"2024-09-09Z","views":86568},{"date":"2024-09-10Z","views":101079},{"date":"2024-09-11Z","views":63701}],"type":"standard","title":"Chester_Bennington","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Chester Bennington</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q19198","titles":{"canonical":"Chester_Bennington","normalized":"Chester Bennington","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Chester Bennington</span>"},"pageid":142809,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Linkin_Park-Rock_im_Park_2014-_by_2eight_3SC0327.jpg/320px-Linkin_Park-Rock_im_Park_2014-_by_2eight_3SC0327.jpg","width":320,"height":482},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Linkin_Park-Rock_im_Park_2014-_by_2eight_3SC0327.jpg","width":1360,"height":2048},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1245252887","tid":"1ca4d228-708e-11ef-b8f0-675a22d49114","timestamp":"2024-09-11T22:35:14Z","description":"American singer (1976–2017)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chester_Bennington"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Chester_Bennington","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chester_Bennington"}},"extract":"Chester Charles Bennington was an American singer who was the lead vocalist of the rock band Linkin Park.
