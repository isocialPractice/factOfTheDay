It has been called \"the defining event of modern Mexican history\". It saw the destruction of the Federal Army, its replacement by a revolutionary army, and the transformation of Mexican culture and government. The northern Constitutionalist faction prevailed on the battlefield and drafted the present-day Constitution of Mexico, which aimed to create a strong central government. Revolutionary generals held power from 1920 to 1940. The revolutionary conflict was primarily a civil war, but foreign powers, having important economic and strategic interests in Mexico, figured in the outcome of Mexico's power struggles; the U.S. involvement was particularly high. The conflict led to the deaths of around one million people, mostly non-combatants.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Mexican Revolution"},{"type":"standard","title":"Emiliano_Zapata","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Emiliano Zapata</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q41718","titles":{"canonical":"Emiliano_Zapata","normalized":"Emiliano Zapata","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Emiliano Zapata</span>"},"pageid":86692,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Emiliano_Zapata4.jpg/320px-Emiliano_Zapata4.jpg","width":320,"height":437},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Emiliano_Zapata4.jpg","width":970,"height":1326},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1282770013","tid":"d0127dc7-0bde-11f0-92ac-f6d07d31024a","timestamp":"2025-03-28T14:13:25Z","description":"Mexican revolutionary (1879–1919)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Zapata","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Zapata?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Zapata?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Emiliano_Zapata"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Zapata","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Emiliano_Zapata","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Zapata?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Emiliano_Zapata"}},"extract":"Emiliano Zapata Salazar was a Mexican revolutionary.

Austria was supported by the Fifth Coalition which included the United Kingdom, Portugal, Spain, and the Kingdoms of Sardinia and Sicily, although the latter two took no part in the fighting. By the start of 1809 much of the French army was committed to the Peninsular War against Britain, Spain and Portugal. After France withdrew 108,000 soldiers from Germany, Austria attacked France to seek the recovery of territories lost in the 1803–1806 War of the Third Coalition. The Austrians hoped Prussia would support them, having recently been defeated by France, but Prussia chose to remain neutral.</p>","normalizedtitle":"War of the Fifth Coalition"},{"type":"standard","title":"Client_state","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Client state</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1151405","titles":{"canonical":"Client_state","normalized":"Client state","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Client state</span>"},"pageid":78359,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1284683433","tid":"50917edb-14ed-11f0-9d1e-dfca5c575af1","timestamp":"2025-04-09T02:49:54Z","description":"State that is economically, politically, or militarily subordinate to another","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_state","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_state?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_state?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Client_state"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_state","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Client_state","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_state?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Client_state"}},"extract":"A client state in the context of international relations is a state that is economically, politically, and militarily subordinated to a more powerful controlling state.
