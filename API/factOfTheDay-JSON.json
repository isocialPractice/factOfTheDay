Having its own unique grammatical, vocabulary, and accent features, AAVE is employed by middle-class Black Americans as the more informal and casual end of a sociolinguistic continuum. However, in formal speaking contexts, speakers tend to switch to more standard English grammar and vocabulary, usually while retaining elements of the vernacular (non-standard) accent. AAVE is widespread throughout the United States, but it is not the native dialect of all African Americans, nor are all of its speakers African American.</p>","normalizedtitle":"African-American Vernacular English"}],"year":1996},{"text":"Mohammad Mofatteh, an Iranian philosopher, was assassinated by the Furqan Group.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Mohammad_Mofatteh","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mohammad Mofatteh</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q6892196","titles":{"canonical":"Mohammad_Mofatteh","normalized":"Mohammad Mofatteh","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mohammad Mofatteh</span>"},"pageid":3044708,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Mohammad_Mofatteh_%2804%29.jpg/330px-Mohammad_Mofatteh_%2804%29.jpg","width":320,"height":442},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Mohammad_Mofatteh_%2804%29.jpg","width":484,"height":668},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1288311751","tid":"f5f2d2c3-26cc-11f0-a389-b8c00fd71073","timestamp":"2025-05-01T20:43:39Z","description":"Iranian philosopher, theologian and political activist (1928–1979)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mofatteh","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mofatteh?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mofatteh?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mohammad_Mofatteh"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mofatteh","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Mohammad_Mofatteh","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mofatteh?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mohammad_Mofatteh"}},"extract":"Mohammad Mofatteh was an Iranian philosopher, theologian, and political activist.

Known as an <b>orbital revolution</b>, examples include the trajectory of a planet around a star, a natural satellite around a planet, or an artificial satellite around an object or position in space such as a planet, moon, asteroid, or Lagrange point. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory, although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits, with the center of mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Orbit"}],"year":1966},{"text":"Ghanaian and other African students organized a protest in Moscow's Red Square in response to the alleged murder of medical student Edmund Assare-Addo.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"1963_Moscow_protest","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">1963 Moscow protest</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q17507595","titles":{"canonical":"1963_Moscow_protest","normalized":"1963 Moscow protest","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">1963 Moscow protest</span>"},"pageid":43305397,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/V%C3%B6r%C3%B6s_t%C3%A9r%2C_balra_a_Kreml%2C_jobbra_az_%C3%81llami_T%C3%B6rt%C3%A9nelmi_M%C3%BAzeum._Fortepan_60908.jpg/330px-V%C3%B6r%C3%B6s_t%C3%A9r%2C_balra_a_Kreml%2C_jobbra_az_%C3%81llami_T%C3%B6rt%C3%A9nelmi_M%C3%BAzeum._Fortepan_60908.jpg","width":320,"height":209},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/V%C3%B6r%C3%B6s_t%C3%A9r%2C_balra_a_Kreml%2C_jobbra_az_%C3%81llami_T%C3%B6rt%C3%A9nelmi_M%C3%BAzeum._Fortepan_60908.jpg","width":5427,"height":3545},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1316471397","tid":"1e12501d-a794-11f0-9126-fe4962bb0f1c","timestamp":"2025-10-12T17:51:45Z","description":"Protests by African students on Red Square","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963_Moscow_protest","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963_Moscow_protest?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963_Moscow_protest?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:1963_Moscow_protest"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963_Moscow_protest","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/1963_Moscow_protest","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963_Moscow_protest?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:1963_Moscow_protest"}},"extract":"On 18 December 1963, a number of students from Ghana and other African countries organized a protest on Moscow's Red Square in response to the alleged murder of the medical student Edmund Assare-Addo.
