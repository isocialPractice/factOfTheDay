The electronic structure of a francium atom is [Rn] 7s<sup>1</sup>; thus, the element is classed as an alkali metal.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Francium"},{"type":"standard","title":"Timeline_of_chemical_element_discoveries","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Timeline of chemical element discoveries</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1195325","titles":{"canonical":"Timeline_of_chemical_element_discoveries","normalized":"Timeline of chemical element discoveries","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Timeline of chemical element discoveries</span>"},"pageid":8200,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1194056221","tid":"e0790f30-acf1-11ee-a080-0d2a23f1a48e","timestamp":"2024-01-07T00:15:25Z","description":"List of history of chemical elements","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_chemical_element_discoveries","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_chemical_element_discoveries?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_chemical_element_discoveries?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Timeline_of_chemical_element_discoveries"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_chemical_element_discoveries","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Timeline_of_chemical_element_discoveries","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_chemical_element_discoveries?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Timeline_of_chemical_element_discoveries"}},"extract":"The discoveries of the 118 chemical elements known to exist as of 2024 are presented here in chronological order.
