It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was a major conflict of the Cold War. While the war was officially fought between North Vietnam and South Vietnam, the north was supported by the Soviet Union, China, and other communist states, while the south was supported by the United States and other anti-communist allies, making the war a proxy war between the United States and the Soviet Union. It lasted almost 20 years, with direct U.S. military involvement ending in 1973. The conflict also spilled over into neighboring states, exacerbating the Laotian Civil War and the Cambodian Civil War, which ended with all three countries officially becoming communist states by 1976.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Vietnam War"},{"type":"standard","title":"South_Vietnam","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">South Vietnam</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q180573","titles":{"canonical":"South_Vietnam","normalized":"South Vietnam","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">South Vietnam</span>"},"pageid":59756,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Flag_of_South_Vietnam.svg/320px-Flag_of_South_Vietnam.svg.png","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Flag_of_South_Vietnam.svg/900px-Flag_of_South_Vietnam.svg.png","width":900,"height":600},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1221217900","tid":"0df2c62a-0578-11ef-9e05-10fc43c0aa7e","timestamp":"2024-04-28T15:57:46Z","description":"Former country in Southeast Asia from 1955 to 1975","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":10.78,"lon":106.7},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:South_Vietnam"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/South_Vietnam","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:South_Vietnam"}},"extract":"South Vietnam, officially the Republic of Vietnam, was a country in Southeast Asia that existed from 1955 to 1975, the period when the southern portion of Vietnam was a member of the Western Bloc during part of the Cold War after the 1954 division of Vietnam.
