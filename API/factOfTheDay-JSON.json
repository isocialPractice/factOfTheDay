It was the most powerful earthquake recorded worldwide since the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, and is tied with the 1906 Ecuador–Colombia and 2010 Chile earthquakes as the sixth-strongest earthquake ever recorded by seismometers. However, it caused minimal damage compared to other earthquakes of similar magnitude. The earthquake caused moderate damage and multiple injuries in Kamchatka Krai and Sakhalin Oblast. The subsequent Pacific-wide tsunami was weaker than expected, with waves approximately 1 m (3 ft) or less in most places. However, a locally high run-up of 19 m (62 ft) as a result of a wave splash was recorded on Shumshu.

As the tower leans a bit due to the wind force, the increased guy tension is resolved into a compression force in the tower or mast and a lateral force that resists the wind load. For example, antenna masts are often held up by three guy-wires at 120° angles. Structures with predictable lateral loads, such as electrical utility poles, may require only a single guy-wire to offset the lateral pull of the electrical wires at a spot where the wires change direction.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Guy-wire"}],"year":1991},{"text":"Tropical Storm Beryl formed over southeastern Louisiana, making it one of the few tropical cyclones to form over land.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Tropical_Storm_Beryl_(1988)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Tropical Storm Beryl (1988)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q7845858","titles":{"canonical":"Tropical_Storm_Beryl_(1988)","normalized":"Tropical Storm Beryl (1988)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Tropical Storm Beryl (1988)</span>"},"pageid":10208996,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Beryl_1988-08-09_1630Z.png/330px-Beryl_1988-08-09_1630Z.png","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Beryl_1988-08-09_1630Z.png","width":1080,"height":1080},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1230460577","tid":"23e4adcf-30d9-11ef-9a9c-4aa50dd903cb","timestamp":"2024-06-22T20:51:04Z","description":"Atlantic tropical storm","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Beryl_(1988)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Beryl_(1988)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Beryl_(1988)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tropical_Storm_Beryl_(1988)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Beryl_(1988)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Tropical_Storm_Beryl_(1988)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Beryl_(1988)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tropical_Storm_Beryl_(1988)"}},"extract":"Tropical Storm Beryl was an unusual Atlantic tropical cyclone that formed over southeastern Louisiana in August 1988.
