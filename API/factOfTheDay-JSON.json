Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i>, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the \"Dance of the Dragons.\"</p>","normalizedtitle":"House of the Dragon"},{"views":53486,"rank":41,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-08-10Z","views":71898},{"date":"2024-08-11Z","views":81336},{"date":"2024-08-12Z","views":145451},{"date":"2024-08-13Z","views":69376},{"date":"2024-08-14Z","views":53486}],"type":"standard","title":"JD_Vance","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">JD Vance</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q28935729","titles":{"canonical":"JD_Vance","normalized":"JD Vance","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">JD Vance</span>"},"pageid":53396477,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Senator_Vance_official_portrait._118th_Congress.jpg/320px-Senator_Vance_official_portrait._118th_Congress.jpg","width":320,"height":400},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Senator_Vance_official_portrait._118th_Congress.jpg","width":6201,"height":7752},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1240345786","tid":"3f43d929-5a8f-11ef-b545-e92be104ac41","timestamp":"2024-08-14T22:47:56Z","description":"American politician (born 1984)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD_Vance","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD_Vance?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD_Vance?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:JD_Vance"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD_Vance","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/JD_Vance","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD_Vance?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:JD_Vance"}},"extract":"James David \"JD\" Vance is an American politician, author, and Marine veteran who has served since 2023 as the junior United States senator from Ohio.

It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which is separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded toward the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was initially a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new Norman ruling class. The castle was also used as a prison from 1100 until 1952, although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries.

It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which is separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded toward the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was initially a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new Norman ruling class. The castle was also used as a prison from 1100 until 1952, although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence.

Hungarian chronicles are unanimous that Peter was executed by order of his successor, Andrew I, but the chronicler Cosmas of Prague's reference to his alleged marriage around 1055 suggests that he may also have survived his second deposition.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Peter, King of Hungary"},{"type":"standard","title":"King_of_Hungary","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">King of Hungary</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q6412254","titles":{"canonical":"King_of_Hungary","normalized":"King of Hungary","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">King of Hungary</span>"},"pageid":324235,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_Kingdom_of_Hungary_%281915-1918%3B_angels%29.svg/320px-Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_Kingdom_of_Hungary_%281915-1918%3B_angels%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":238},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_Kingdom_of_Hungary_%281915-1918%3B_angels%29.svg/1000px-Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_Kingdom_of_Hungary_%281915-1918%3B_angels%29.svg.png","width":1000,"height":745},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1230686994","tid":"fe40cfef-31dc-11ef-9656-89b533ebed05","timestamp":"2024-06-24T03:51:10Z","description":"Monarch of the Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1918)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Hungary","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Hungary?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Hungary?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:King_of_Hungary"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Hungary","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/King_of_Hungary","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Hungary?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:King_of_Hungary"}},"extract":"The King of Hungary was the ruling head of state of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1000 to 1918.
