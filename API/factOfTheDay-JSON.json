Its territory consisted of what are now the regions of Oltenia, Transylvania and Banat. During Roman rule, it was organized as an imperial province on the borders of the empire. It is estimated that the population of Roman Dacia ranged from 650,000 to 1,200,000. It was conquered by Trajan (98â€“117) after two campaigns that devastated the Dacian Kingdom of Decebalus. However, the Romans did not occupy its entirety; CriÈ™ana, MaramureÈ™, and most of Moldavia remained under the Free Dacians.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Roman Dacia"},{"type":"standard","title":"Roman_province","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Roman province</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q182547","titles":{"canonical":"Roman_province","normalized":"Roman province","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Roman province</span>"},"pageid":314732,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Roman_SPQR_banner.svg/320px-Roman_SPQR_banner.svg.png","width":320,"height":254},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Roman_SPQR_banner.svg/289px-Roman_SPQR_banner.svg.png","width":289,"height":229},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1305003514","tid":"6064a889-7523-11f0-b611-51b1f0313dd1","timestamp":"2025-08-09T13:18:45Z","description":"Ancient Roman administrative regions","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Roman_province"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Roman_province","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Roman_province"}},"extract":"The Roman provinces were the administrative regions of Ancient Rome outside Roman Italy that were controlled by the Romans under the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire.
