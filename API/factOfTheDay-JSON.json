The earliest conflicts began during the Byzantine–Ottoman wars, waged in Anatolia in the late 13th century before entering Europe in the mid-14th century with the Bulgarian–Ottoman wars. The mid-15th century saw the Serbian–Ottoman wars and the Albanian-Ottoman wars. Much of this period was characterized by the Ottoman expansion into the Balkans. The Ottoman Empire made further inroads into Central Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, culminating in the peak of Ottoman territorial claims in Europe.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Ottoman wars in Europe"},{"type":"standard","title":"Battle_of_Krbava_Field","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Battle of Krbava Field</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q694379","titles":{"canonical":"Battle_of_Krbava_Field","normalized":"Battle of Krbava Field","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Battle of Krbava Field</span>"},"pageid":2942787,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Battle_of_Krbava_Field.jpg/320px-Battle_of_Krbava_Field.jpg","width":320,"height":360},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Battle_of_Krbava_Field.jpg","width":708,"height":796},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1241990070","tid":"73438798-6203-11ef-8150-08622ed780e8","timestamp":"2024-08-24T10:27:23Z","description":"1493 battle of the Hundred Years' Croatian-Ottoman War","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":44.6,"lon":15.7},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Krbava_Field","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Krbava_Field?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Krbava_Field?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Krbava_Field"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Krbava_Field","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Battle_of_Krbava_Field","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Krbava_Field?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Krbava_Field"}},"extract":"The Battle of Krbava Field was fought between the Ottoman Empire of Bayezid II and an army of the Kingdom of Croatia, at the time in personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary, on 9 September 1493, in the Krbava field, a part of the Lika region in Croatia.","extract_html":"<p>The <b>Battle of Krbava Field</b> was fought between the Ottoman Empire of Bayezid II and an army of the Kingdom of Croatia, at the time in personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary, on 9 September 1493, in the Krbava field, a part of the Lika region in Croatia.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Battle of Krbava Field"},{"type":"standard","title":"Sanjak_of_Bosnia","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Sanjak of Bosnia</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q12628176","titles":{"canonical":"Sanjak_of_Bosnia","normalized":"Sanjak of Bosnia","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Sanjak of Bosnia</span>"},"pageid":30806302,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Flag_of_the_Ottoman_Empire_%281844%E2%80%931922%29.svg/320px-Flag_of_the_Ottoman_Empire_%281844%E2%80%931922%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Flag_of_the_Ottoman_Empire_%281844%E2%80%931922%29.svg/1200px-Flag_of_the_Ottoman_Empire_%281844%E2%80%931922%29.svg.png","width":1200,"height":800},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1209941104","tid":"6097dcc4-d2e4-11ee-9e52-7f4958e83547","timestamp":"2024-02-24T07:14:41Z","description":"1463–1878 Ottoman sanjak in Southeast Europe","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjak_of_Bosnia","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjak_of_Bosnia?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjak_of_Bosnia?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sanjak_of_Bosnia"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjak_of_Bosnia","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Sanjak_of_Bosnia","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjak_of_Bosnia?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sanjak_of_Bosnia"}},"extract":"Sanjak of Bosnia was one of the sanjaks of the Ottoman Empire established in 1463 when the lands conquered from the Bosnian Kingdom were transformed into a sanjak and Isa-Beg Isaković was appointed its first sanjakbey.
