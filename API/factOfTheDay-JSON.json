The exact number of how many took part in the uprising is a matter of debate. The rebellion began on 18 August 1823 and lasted for two days. Their goal was full emancipation. The uprising was triggered by a widespread but mistaken belief that Parliament had passed a law that abolished slavery and that this was being withheld by the colonial rulers. Instigated chiefly by Jack Gladstone, an enslaved man from the \"Success\" plantation, the rebellion also involved his father, Quamina, and other senior members of their church group.

Syria remained the Umayyads' main power base thereafter, with Damascus as their capital.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Umayyad Caliphate"},{"type":"standard","title":"Battle_of_Marj_Rahit_(684)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Battle of Marj Rahit (684)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2281774","titles":{"canonical":"Battle_of_Marj_Rahit_(684)","normalized":"Battle of Marj Rahit (684)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Battle of Marj Rahit (684)</span>"},"pageid":38206815,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1217592604","tid":"4821e1a9-f44a-11ee-b587-c3d4c32eef78","timestamp":"2024-04-06T19:17:17Z","description":"Early battle of the Second Fitna","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":33.58388889,"lon":36.46166667},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marj_Rahit_(684)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marj_Rahit_(684)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marj_Rahit_(684)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Marj_Rahit_(684)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marj_Rahit_(684)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Battle_of_Marj_Rahit_(684)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marj_Rahit_(684)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Marj_Rahit_(684)"}},"extract":"The Battle of Marj Rahit was one of the early battles of the Second Fitna.
