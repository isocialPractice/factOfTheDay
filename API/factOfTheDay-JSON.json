It is the first of a two-part film adaptation of the stage musical of the same name by Stephen Schwartz and Holzman, which in turn was loosely based on the 1995 novel of the same name by Gregory Maguire. The film stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, with Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Bowen Yang, Marissa Bode, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Yeoh, and Jeff Goldblum in supporting roles. Set in the Land of Oz, largely before Dorothy Gale's arrival from Kansas, the plot covers the events of the musical's first act, following green-skinned Elphaba's studies at Shiz University and the beginning of her path to ultimately becoming the Wicked Witch of the West, alongside an unlikely friendship with a classmate who later becomes Glinda the Good Witch of the North.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Wicked (2024 film)"},{"views":158262,"rank":11,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-11-16Z","views":39904},{"date":"2024-11-17Z","views":46008},{"date":"2024-11-18Z","views":58523},{"date":"2024-11-19Z","views":66870},{"date":"2024-11-20Z","views":158262}],"type":"standard","title":"2024_Maharashtra_Legislative_Assembly_election","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">2024 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q106492726","titles":{"canonical":"2024_Maharashtra_Legislative_Assembly_election","normalized":"2024 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">2024 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election</span>"},"pageid":67260267,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Eknath_Shinde_and_Devendra_Fadnavis_with_PM_Narendra_Modi_Cropped%282%29.jpg/320px-Eknath_Shinde_and_Devendra_Fadnavis_with_PM_Narendra_Modi_Cropped%282%29.jpg","width":320,"height":351},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Eknath_Shinde_and_Devendra_Fadnavis_with_PM_Narendra_Modi_Cropped%282%29.jpg","width":330,"height":362},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1258716153","tid":"821ed533-a7cc-11ef-9eba-9a421dfb2592","timestamp":"2024-11-21T05:50:27Z","description":"Upcoming assembly elections in Maharashtra","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Maharashtra_Legislative_Assembly_election","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Maharashtra_Legislative_Assembly_election?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Maharashtra_Legislative_Assembly_election?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2024_Maharashtra_Legislative_Assembly_election"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Maharashtra_Legislative_Assembly_election","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/2024_Maharashtra_Legislative_Assembly_election","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Maharashtra_Legislative_Assembly_election?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2024_Maharashtra_Legislative_Assembly_election"}},"extract":"A General assembly election was held in Maharashtra on 20 November 2024 to elect the 288 members of the 15th Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, the counting and the results will be declared on 23 November 2024.","extract_html":"<p>A General assembly election was held in Maharashtra on 20 November 2024 to elect the 288 members of the 15th Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, the counting and the results will be declared on 23 November 2024.</p>","normalizedtitle":"2024 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election"},{"views":155030,"rank":12,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-11-16Z","views":2618},{"date":"2024-11-17Z","views":2867},{"date":"2024-11-18Z","views":3758},{"date":"2024-11-19Z","views":9272},{"date":"2024-11-20Z","views":155030}],"type":"standard","title":"Susan_Smith","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Susan Smith</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2449527","titles":{"canonical":"Susan_Smith","normalized":"Susan Smith","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Susan Smith</span>"},"pageid":168666,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1f/Susan_Smith_%28SC_convict%29.png","width":177,"height":208},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1f/Susan_Smith_%28SC_convict%29.png","width":177,"height":208},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1258703125","tid":"f059aacd-a7b8-11ef-a4b3-2a0f879374f3","timestamp":"2024-11-21T03:30:22Z","description":"American murderer of children (born 1971)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Smith","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Smith?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Smith?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Susan_Smith"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Smith","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Susan_Smith","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Smith?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Susan_Smith"}},"extract":"Susan Leigh Smith is an American woman who was convicted of murdering her two sons, three-year-old Michael and one-year-old Alexander, in 1994 by strapping her children in their car seats, and rolling her car containing her two children into John D.
