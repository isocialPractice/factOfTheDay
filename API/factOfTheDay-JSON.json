A leading figure in the pop art movement, Warhol is considered one of the most important American artists of the second half of the 20th century. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, advertising, and celebrity culture that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, silkscreening, photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best-known works include the silkscreen paintings <i>Campbell's Soup Cans</i> (1962) and <i>Marilyn Diptych</i> (1962), the experimental films <i>Empire</i> (1964) and <i>Chelsea Girls</i> (1966), and the multimedia events known as the <i>Exploding Plastic Inevitable</i> (1966–67).</p>","normalizedtitle":"Andy Warhol"},{"type":"standard","title":"Campbell's_Soup_Cans","displaytitle":"<i>Campbell's Soup Cans</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2697937","titles":{"canonical":"Campbell's_Soup_Cans","normalized":"Campbell's Soup Cans","display":"<i>Campbell's Soup Cans</i>"},"pageid":7536709,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1f/Campbells_Soup_Cans_MOMA.jpg/320px-Campbells_Soup_Cans_MOMA.jpg","width":320,"height":181},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1f/Campbells_Soup_Cans_MOMA.jpg","width":419,"height":237},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1233304456","tid":"be6cfe47-3d1b-11ef-a0d0-aa47e4cd542b","timestamp":"2024-07-08T11:18:04Z","description":"1962 artwork by Andy Warhol","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell's_Soup_Cans","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell's_Soup_Cans?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell's_Soup_Cans?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Campbell's_Soup_Cans"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell's_Soup_Cans","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Campbell's_Soup_Cans","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell's_Soup_Cans?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Campbell's_Soup_Cans"}},"extract":"Campbell's Soup Cans is a work of art produced between November 1961 and June 1962 by the American artist Andy Warhol.
