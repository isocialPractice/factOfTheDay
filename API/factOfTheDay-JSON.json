Often referred to as the \"Fall Classic\", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike. The best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920, 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff. Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. Players, coaches and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory; however, they have received other items such as pocket watches and medallions in the past. The winning team is traditionally invited to the White House to meet the President of the United States.","extract_html":"<p>The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) and concludes the MLB postseason. First played in 1903, the World Series championship is a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and American League (AL). Often referred to as the \"Fall Classic\", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike. The best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920, 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff. Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. Players, coaches and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory; however, they have received other items such as pocket watches and medallions in the past. The winning team is traditionally invited to the White House to meet the President of the United States.</p>","normalizedtitle":"List of World Series champions"},{"views":63281,"rank":48,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-10-23Z","views":8066},{"date":"2024-10-24Z","views":4300},{"date":"2024-10-25Z","views":5320},{"date":"2024-10-26Z","views":39644},{"date":"2024-10-27Z","views":63281}],"type":"standard","title":"Tommy_Edman","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Tommy Edman</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q64747492","titles":{"canonical":"Tommy_Edman","normalized":"Tommy Edman","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Tommy Edman</span>"},"pageid":57016668,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Tommy_Edman_9.22.22.jpg/320px-Tommy_Edman_9.22.22.jpg","width":320,"height":481},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Tommy_Edman_9.22.22.jpg","width":1707,"height":2565},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1253672251","tid":"c4a40a7c-9436-11ef-a80f-e545e441e16b","timestamp":"2024-10-27T07:40:42Z","description":"American baseball player (born 1995)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Edman","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Edman?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Edman?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tommy_Edman"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Edman","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Tommy_Edman","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Edman?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tommy_Edman"}},"extract":"Thomas Hyunsu Edman is an American professional baseball utility player for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB).

The twentieth named storm of the annual typhoon season, Trami developed into a low-pressure area and later into a tropical depression west of Guam on October 19, moving westward along the southern periphery. After entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility, PAGASA named the depression Kristine on October 20. The storm was embedded within a larger trough that extended from the Philippine Islands eastward almost to Guam. Early the next day, satellite imagery showed that the depression was exposed, displaying elongated circulation and convective bands wrapping around its center. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system to a tropical storm, naming it Trami, as spiral bands of deep convection formed around the low-level circulation, while Trami's central dense overcast (CDO) became sheared and displaced from its central circulation. By October 23, the JMA reported that Trami had intensified into a severe tropical storm as it moved west-northwestward and made landfall in Divilacan, Isabela. The following day, Trami emerged over the coastal waters of southern Ilocos Sur, with surface observations and radar data indicating a lee-side jump that left the remnants of its circulation center over Northern Luzon while mid-level rotation shifted into the eastern South China Sea; later, satellite imagery revealed a consolidating CDO, indicating a well-defined circulation with most deep convection located to the south. By late October 26, both the JMA and Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that Trami had reached its peak intensity, with sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) over 10 and 1-minute intervals, and a central pressure of 970 hPa (28.64 inHg). Trami encountered strong easterly vertical wind shear as it approached the coast of Vietnam, causing its core convection to become more linear.

Of the four Black Arrow launches, two were orbital launches, the first of which, on 2 September 1970, failed, and the second, on 28 October 1971, succeeded, placing the Prospero satellite into low Earth orbit.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Woomera Launch Area 5"},{"type":"standard","title":"Woomera,_South_Australia","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Woomera, South Australia</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q11068811","titles":{"canonical":"Woomera,_South_Australia","normalized":"Woomera, South Australia","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Woomera, South Australia</span>"},"pageid":863613,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Woomera.jpg/320px-Woomera.jpg","width":320,"height":212},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Woomera.jpg","width":1185,"height":786},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1251975287","tid":"bddd2ca6-8dcc-11ef-ab21-28bd5d518c9a","timestamp":"2024-10-19T03:46:37Z","description":"Town in South Australia","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":-31.2,"lon":136.8225},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woomera%2C_South_Australia","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woomera%2C_South_Australia?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woomera%2C_South_Australia?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Woomera%2C_South_Australia"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woomera%2C_South_Australia","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Woomera%2C_South_Australia","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woomera%2C_South_Australia?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Woomera%2C_South_Australia"}},"extract":"Woomera, unofficially Woomera village, refers to the domestic area of RAAF Base Woomera.
