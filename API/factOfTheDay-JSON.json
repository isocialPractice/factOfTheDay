Central America is usually defined as consisting of eight countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico, and Panama. Within Central America is the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from southern Mexico to southeastern Panama. Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, there is a high amount of seismic activity in the region, such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, which has resulted in death, injury, and property damage.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Central America"},{"type":"standard","title":"Spanish_Empire","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Spanish Empire</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q80702","titles":{"canonical":"Spanish_Empire","normalized":"Spanish Empire","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Spanish Empire</span>"},"pageid":303062,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Flag_of_Cross_of_Burgundy.svg/320px-Flag_of_Cross_of_Burgundy.svg.png","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Flag_of_Cross_of_Burgundy.svg/900px-Flag_of_Cross_of_Burgundy.svg.png","width":900,"height":600},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1242825825","tid":"c2d4ccd5-6596-11ef-9257-2708fae55288","timestamp":"2024-08-28T23:39:26Z","description":"Colonial empire between 1492 and 1976","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spanish_Empire"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Spanish_Empire","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spanish_Empire"}},"extract":"The Spanish Empire, sometimes referred to as the Hispanic Monarchy or the Catholic Monarchy, was a colonial empire that existed between 1492 and 1976.
