These were the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the European Atomic Energy Community, and the European Economic Community (EEC), the last of which was renamed the <i>European Community</i> (<i>EC</i>) in 1993 by the Maastricht Treaty establishing the European Union. The European Union was established at that time more as a concept rather than an entity, while the Communities remained the actual subjects of international law impersonating the rather abstract Union, becoming at the same time its first pillar. In popular language, however, the singular <i>European Community</i> was sometimes used interchangeably with the plural phrase, in the sense of referring to all three entities.</p>","normalizedtitle":"European Communities"}],"year":1992},{"text":"The Troubles: The Provisional Irish Republican Army shelled 10 Downing Street with mortars in a failed attempt to assassinate British prime minister John Major.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"The_Troubles","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">The Troubles</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q815436","titles":{"canonical":"The_Troubles","normalized":"The Troubles","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">The Troubles</span>"},"pageid":30770,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Map_of_Ireland%27s_capitals.png/320px-Map_of_Ireland%27s_capitals.png","width":320,"height":408},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Map_of_Ireland%27s_capitals.png","width":1630,"height":2078},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1273411505","tid":"459e39ea-e11f-11ef-9e5d-337fdfdcc21a","timestamp":"2025-02-02T04:36:30Z","description":"1960s–1990s conflict in Northern Ireland","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Troubles"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/The_Troubles","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Troubles"}},"extract":"The Troubles were an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland that lasted for about 30 years from the late 1960s to 1998.
