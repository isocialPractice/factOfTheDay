Granada is located at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, at the confluence of four rivers, the Darro, the Genil, the Monachil and the Beiro. Ascribed to the Vega de Granada <i>comarca</i>, the city sits at an average elevation of 738 m (2,421 ft) above sea level, yet is only one hour by car from the Mediterranean coast, the Costa Tropical. Nearby is the Sierra Nevada Ski Station, where the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996 were held.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Granada"},{"type":"standard","title":"Muhammad_III_of_Granada","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Muhammad III of Granada</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q704786","titles":{"canonical":"Muhammad_III_of_Granada","normalized":"Muhammad III of Granada","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Muhammad III of Granada</span>"},"pageid":12533934,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1252947135","tid":"085ef521-9163-11ef-a7d9-ba7233e9f6b5","timestamp":"2024-10-23T17:20:00Z","description":"Sultan of Granada from 1302 to 1309","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_III_of_Granada","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_III_of_Granada?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_III_of_Granada?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Muhammad_III_of_Granada"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_III_of_Granada","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Muhammad_III_of_Granada","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_III_of_Granada?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Muhammad_III_of_Granada"}},"extract":"Muhammad III was the ruler of the Emirate of Granada in Al-Andalus on the Iberian Peninsula from 8 April 1302 until 14 March 1309, and a member of the Nasrid dynasty.
