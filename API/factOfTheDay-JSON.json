The number of electoral votes exercised by each state is equal to that state's congressional delegation which is the number of Senators (two) plus the number of Representatives for that state. Each state appoints electors using legal procedures determined by its legislature. Federal office holders, including senators and representatives, cannot be electors. Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment granted the federal District of Columbia three electors. A simple majority of electoral votes is required to elect the president and vice president. If no candidate achieves a majority, a contingent election is held by the House of Representatives, to elect the president, and by the Senate, to elect the vice president.</p>","normalizedtitle":"United States Electoral College"},{"views":101801,"rank":46,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-11-03Z","views":28582},{"date":"2024-11-04Z","views":38152},{"date":"2024-11-05Z","views":83363},{"date":"2024-11-06Z","views":256837},{"date":"2024-11-07Z","views":101801}],"type":"standard","title":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Republican Party (United States)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q29468","titles":{"canonical":"Republican_Party_(United_States)","normalized":"Republican Party (United States)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Republican Party (United States)</span>"},"pageid":32070,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Republican_Party_Disc_%28alternate%29.svg/320px-Republican_Party_Disc_%28alternate%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":316},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Republican_Party_Disc_%28alternate%29.svg/2943px-Republican_Party_Disc_%28alternate%29.svg.png","width":2943,"height":2909},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1256086780","tid":"be4158e3-9d83-11ef-be83-9f7528b6f81f","timestamp":"2024-11-08T03:44:23Z","description":"American political party","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Republican_Party_(United_States)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Republican_Party_(United_States)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Republican_Party_(United_States)"}},"extract":"The Republican Party, also known as the GOP, is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States.

Campeche was part of the province of Yucatán, but split off in the mid-19th century, mostly due to political friction with the city of Mérida. Much of the state's recent economic revival is due to the discovery of petroleum offshore in the 1970s, which has made the coastal cities of Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen important economic centers. The state has important Mayan and colonial sites; however, these are not as well-known or visited as much as others in the Yucatán.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Campeche"}],"story":"<!--Nov 01-->The ruins of a <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Maya_civilization\" title=\"Maya civilization\" id=\"mwGQ\">Maya</a> city, dubbed <b id=\"mwGg\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Valeriana_(city)\" title=\"Valeriana (city)\" id=\"mwGw\">Valeriana</a></b>, are discovered in <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Campeche\" title=\"Campeche\" id=\"mwHA\">Campeche</a>, Mexico."}],"onthisday":[{"text":"Second Nagorno-Karabakh War: Azerbaijani forces defeated the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh in the Battle of Shusha, reclaiming the town after 28 years.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Second_Nagorno-Karabakh_War","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Second Nagorno-Karabakh War</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q99659280","titles":{"canonical":"Second_Nagorno-Karabakh_War","normalized":"Second Nagorno-Karabakh War","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Second Nagorno-Karabakh War</span>"},"pageid":65431221,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/2020_Nagorno-Karabakh_war.svg/320px-2020_Nagorno-Karabakh_war.svg.png","width":320,"height":253},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/2020_Nagorno-Karabakh_war.svg/512px-2020_Nagorno-Karabakh_war.svg.png","width":512,"height":405},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1255413952","tid":"8458116e-9aef-11ef-ba19-318866d31484","timestamp":"2024-11-04T20:58:18Z","description":"Armed conflict in South Caucasus","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Nagorno-Karabakh_War","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Nagorno-Karabakh_War?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Nagorno-Karabakh_War?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Second_Nagorno-Karabakh_War"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Nagorno-Karabakh_War","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Second_Nagorno-Karabakh_War","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Nagorno-Karabakh_War?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Second_Nagorno-Karabakh_War"}},"extract":"The Second Nagorno-Karabakh War was an armed conflict in 2020 that took place in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding occupied territories.

The main thrust of the Italian invasion occurred in the Epirus sector, with a further flanking move through the Pindus mountains. In Epirus, the Greeks held the Elaia–Kalamas river line, and, even though the Greek army was outnumbered, the local Greek forces under Major General Charalambos Katsimitros stopped the Italian advance. Along with the Italian failure in the Battle of Pindus, these Greek successes signified the complete failure of the Italian invasion, leading to the dismissal of the Italian commander in Albania, Sebastiano Visconti Prasca, on 9 November.

The battle was fought between the Greeks and the Italians during the initial stage of the Greco-Italian War in World War II.

The main thrust of the Italian invasion occurred in the Epirus sector, with a further flanking move through the Pindus mountains. In Epirus, the Greeks held the Elaia–Kalamas river line, and, even though the Greek army was outnumbered, the local Greek forces under Major General Charalambos Katsimitros stopped the Italian advance.
