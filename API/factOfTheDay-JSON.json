Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist described as the \"father of the atomic bomb\" for his role in the Manhattan Project, the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons. Based on the 2005 biography <i>American Prometheus</i> by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles Oppenheimer's studies, his direction of the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II, and his fall from grace due to his 1954 security hearing, framed between his perspective and that of United States Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss. The film stars Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr. as Strauss. The ensemble supporting cast includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Oppenheimer (film)"},{"type":"standard","title":"Emma_Thomas","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Emma Thomas</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q242951","titles":{"canonical":"Emma_Thomas","normalized":"Emma Thomas","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Emma Thomas</span>"},"pageid":5267291,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Emma_Thomas_2.jpg/320px-Emma_Thomas_2.jpg","width":320,"height":439},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Emma_Thomas_2.jpg","width":406,"height":557},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1213449037","tid":"7d0d8860-e0ec-11ee-84d2-9ad85faf943c","timestamp":"2024-03-13T03:48:01Z","description":"British film producer (born 1971)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Thomas","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Thomas?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Thomas?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Emma_Thomas"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Thomas","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Emma_Thomas","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Thomas?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Emma_Thomas"}},"extract":"Emma Thomas Nolan is a British film producer best known for her creative partnership with her husband, Christopher Nolan.
