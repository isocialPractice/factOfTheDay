The bombing of Air India Flight 182 is the worst terrorist attack in Canadian history and was the world's deadliest act of aviation terrorism until the September 11 attacks in 2001. It remains the deadliest aviation incident in the history of Air India. The masterminds behind the bombing are believed to be Inderjit Singh Reyat, a dual British-Canadian national, who pleaded guilty in 2003, and Talwinder Singh Parmar, separatist leader, who was one of the key individuals associated with the extremist group Babbar Khalsa.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Air India Flight 182"},{"type":"standard","title":"Atlantic_Ocean","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Atlantic Ocean</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q97","titles":{"canonical":"Atlantic_Ocean","normalized":"Atlantic Ocean","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Atlantic Ocean</span>"},"pageid":698,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Atlantic_Ocean_-_en.png/320px-Atlantic_Ocean_-_en.png","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Atlantic_Ocean_-_en.png","width":328,"height":328},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1296063064","tid":"798a5218-4b8f-11f0-9ce3-765b252625d3","timestamp":"2025-06-17T15:26:44Z","description":"Oceanic division","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":0,"lon":-25},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Atlantic_Ocean"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Atlantic_Ocean","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Atlantic_Ocean"}},"extract":"The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's five oceanic divisions, with an area of about 85,133,000 km2 (32,870,000 sq mi).

Alberta's capital is Edmonton; its largest city is Calgary. The two cities are Alberta's largest census metropolitan areas. More than half of Albertans live in Edmonton or Calgary, which encourages a continuing rivalry between the two cities. English is the province's official language. In 2016, 76.0% of Albertans were anglophone, 1.8% were francophone and 22.2% were allophone.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Alberta"},{"type":"standard","title":"National_parks_of_Canada","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">National parks of Canada</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1896949","titles":{"canonical":"National_parks_of_Canada","normalized":"National parks of Canada","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">National parks of Canada</span>"},"pageid":585118,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Banff_National_Park_-_Lake_Herbert.jpg/330px-Banff_National_Park_-_Lake_Herbert.jpg","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Banff_National_Park_-_Lake_Herbert.jpg","width":4272,"height":2848},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1292862312","tid":"407a569a-3c59-11f0-ad7b-152e643d6530","timestamp":"2025-05-29T06:50:48Z","description":"Parks owned and maintained by the federal government of Canada","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_parks_of_Canada","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_parks_of_Canada?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_parks_of_Canada?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:National_parks_of_Canada"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_parks_of_Canada","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/National_parks_of_Canada","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_parks_of_Canada?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:National_parks_of_Canada"}},"extract":"National parks of Canada are vast natural spaces located throughout the country that are protected by Parks Canada, a government agency.
