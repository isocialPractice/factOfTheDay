The hurricane intensified further as it entered the Caribbean Sea, peaking as a CategoryÂ 5 hurricane early the next morning before slowly weakening to a high-end Category 2 hurricane on July 4. It then briefly re-intensified to a Category 3 before weakening slightly just prior to making landfall in southeastern Mexico. Then, after crossing the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula, where it weakened to a tropical storm, the system moved into the Gulf of Mexico, where it gradually reorganized into a Category 1 hurricane by July 8.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Hurricane Beryl"},{"type":"standard","title":"Saffirâ€“Simpson_scale","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Saffirâ€“Simpson scale</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q205801","titles":{"canonical":"Saffirâ€“Simpson_scale","normalized":"Saffirâ€“Simpson scale","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Saffirâ€“Simpson scale</span>"},"pageid":255313,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1232898456","tid":"f3802f7f-3b5e-11ef-b15a-9def73d02f9f","timestamp":"2024-07-06T06:14:07Z","description":"Hurricane intensity scale","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale"}},"extract":"The Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) classifies hurricanesâ€”which in the Western Hemisphere are tropical cyclones that exceed the intensities of tropical depressions and tropical stormsâ€”into five categories distinguished by the intensities of their sustained winds.

The initial leaders of the anti-Swedish alliance were Peter I of Russia, Frederick IV of Denmarkâ€“Norway and Augustus II the Strong of Saxonyâ€“Polandâ€“Lithuania. Frederick IV and Augustus II were defeated by Sweden, under Charles XII, and forced out of the alliance in 1700 and 1706 respectively, but rejoined it in 1709 after the defeat of Charles XII at the Battle of Poltava. George I of Great Britain and the Electorate of Hanover joined the coalition in 1714 for Hanover and in 1717 for Britain, and Frederick William I of Brandenburg-Prussia joined it in 1715.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Great Northern War"},{"type":"standard","title":"Charles_XII_of_Sweden","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Charles XII of Sweden</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q52934","titles":{"canonical":"Charles_XII_of_Sweden","normalized":"Charles XII of Sweden","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Charles XII of Sweden</span>"},"pageid":104944,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Copy_Charles_XII_-_Nationalmuseum_-_17886.png/320px-Copy_Charles_XII_-_Nationalmuseum_-_17886.png","width":320,"height":402},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Copy_Charles_XII_-_Nationalmuseum_-_17886.png","width":677,"height":850},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1227819940","tid":"b52936d4-252a-11ef-8ad9-12115c8252ec","timestamp":"2024-06-08T00:04:43Z","description":"King of Sweden from 1697 to 1718","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XII_of_Sweden","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XII_of_Sweden?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XII_of_Sweden?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Charles_XII_of_Sweden"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XII_of_Sweden","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Charles_XII_of_Sweden","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XII_of_Sweden?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Charles_XII_of_Sweden"}},"extract":"Charles XII, sometimes Carl XII or Carolus Rex, was King of Sweden from 1697 to 1718.
