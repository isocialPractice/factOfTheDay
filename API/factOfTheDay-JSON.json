Though born in London, Woodruff spent his youth in Australia, where he earned degrees in electrical engineering and medicine. Having completed his studies shortly after the outbreak of World War II, he joined the Australian Army Medical Corps, but was soon captured by Japanese forces and imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp. While there, he devised an ingenious method of extracting nutrients from agricultural wastes to prevent malnutrition among his fellow POWs.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Michael Woodruff"},{"type":"standard","title":"Kidney_transplantation","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Kidney transplantation</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q740909","titles":{"canonical":"Kidney_transplantation","normalized":"Kidney transplantation","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Kidney transplantation</span>"},"pageid":1584036,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Kidtransplant.svg/330px-Kidtransplant.svg.png","width":320,"height":239},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Kidtransplant.svg/607px-Kidtransplant.svg.png","width":607,"height":453},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1319304997","tid":"2342ef41-b45e-11f0-9d33-ec9b242d960a","timestamp":"2025-10-29T00:28:06Z","description":"Medical procedure","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kidney_transplantation"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Kidney_transplantation","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kidney_transplantation"}},"extract":"Kidney transplant or renal transplant is the organ transplant of a kidney into a patient with end-stage kidney disease (ESRD).
