Over hundreds of years, custom grew to become law concerning maintenance and repairs, as first formally discussed in Stair's 1681 writings on Scots property law. In Scotland, these are now governed by the Tenements Act, which replaced the old Law of the Tenement and created a new system of common ownership and procedures concerning repairs and maintenance of tenements. Tenements with one- or two-room flats provided popular rented accommodation for workers, but in some inner-city areas, overcrowding and maintenance problems led to shanty towns, which have been cleared and redeveloped. In more affluent areas, tenement flats form spacious privately owned houses, some with up to six bedrooms, which continue to be desirable properties.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Tenement"},{"type":"standard","title":"West_Berlin","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">West Berlin</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q56036","titles":{"canonical":"West_Berlin","normalized":"West Berlin","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">West Berlin</span>"},"pageid":33170,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Flag_of_Berlin.svg/320px-Flag_of_Berlin.svg.png","width":320,"height":192},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Flag_of_Berlin.svg/1000px-Flag_of_Berlin.svg.png","width":1000,"height":600},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1241259585","tid":"ccd65d28-5ec3-11ef-8caa-ab0ffae20196","timestamp":"2024-08-20T07:14:12Z","description":"Political enclave that existed between 1948 and 1990","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":52.5,"lon":13.28},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:West_Berlin"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/West_Berlin","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:West_Berlin"}},"extract":"West Berlin was a political enclave which comprised the western part of Berlin from 1948 until 1990, during the Cold War.
