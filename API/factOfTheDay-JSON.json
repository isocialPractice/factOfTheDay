It began in the early 1960s, and continued through the early 1970s. It is often synonymous with cultural liberalism and with the various social changes of the decade. The effects of the movement have been ongoing to the present day. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the civil rights movement in the United States had made significant progress, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and with the intensification of the Vietnam War that same year, it became revolutionary to some. As the movement progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding respect for the individual, human sexuality, women's rights, traditional modes of authority, rights of people of color, end of racial segregation, experimentation with psychoactive drugs, and differing interpretations of the American Dream. Many key movements related to these issues were born or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Counterculture of the 1960s"},{"type":"standard","title":"Summer_of_Love","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Summer of Love</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q932701","titles":{"canonical":"Summer_of_Love","normalized":"Summer of Love","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Summer of Love</span>"},"pageid":29204,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/KFRC_Fantasy_Fair_Dryden_Balin_Kantner.png/320px-KFRC_Fantasy_Fair_Dryden_Balin_Kantner.png","width":320,"height":214},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/KFRC_Fantasy_Fair_Dryden_Balin_Kantner.png","width":1280,"height":854},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1268752536","tid":"050f28b9-d007-11ef-a80a-b6403ab02889","timestamp":"2025-01-11T10:30:04Z","description":"1967 social phenomenon in San Francisco","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Love","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Love?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Love?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Summer_of_Love"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Love","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Summer_of_Love","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Love?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Summer_of_Love"}},"extract":"The Summer of Love was a major social phenomenon that occurred in San Francisco during the summer of 1967.

He is best remembered today for his development, along with Eugène Scribe, of the well-made play. He also wrote several plays that were made into popular 19th-century operas such as <i>La Tosca</i> (1887) on which Giacomo Puccini's opera <i>Tosca</i> (1900) is based, and <i>Fédora</i> (1882) and <i>Madame Sans-Gêne</i> (1893) that provided the subjects for the lyrical dramas <i>Fedora</i> (1898) and <i>Madame Sans-Gêne</i> (1915) by Umberto Giordano. His play <i>Gismonda</i>, from 1894, was also adapted into an opera of the same name by Henry Février.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Victorien Sardou"},{"type":"standard","title":"Teatro_dell'Opera_di_Roma","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Teatro dell&#039;Opera di Roma</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1050350","titles":{"canonical":"Teatro_dell'Opera_di_Roma","normalized":"Teatro dell'Opera di Roma","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Teatro dell&#039;Opera di Roma</span>"},"pageid":3877858,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Teatro_dell%27Opera_a_Roma.JPG/320px-Teatro_dell%27Opera_a_Roma.JPG","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Teatro_dell%27Opera_a_Roma.JPG","width":3072,"height":2304},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1264452961","tid":"dc4ae6df-c006-11ef-bc21-35b8466ee511","timestamp":"2024-12-22T01:48:37Z","description":"Opera house in Rome, Italy","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":41.90083333,"lon":12.49555556},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_dell'Opera_di_Roma","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_dell'Opera_di_Roma?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_dell'Opera_di_Roma?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Teatro_dell'Opera_di_Roma"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_dell'Opera_di_Roma","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Teatro_dell'Opera_di_Roma","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_dell'Opera_di_Roma?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Teatro_dell'Opera_di_Roma"}},"extract":"\nThe Teatro dell'Opera di Roma is an opera house in Rome, Italy.
