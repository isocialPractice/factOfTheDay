It is the 12th largest U.S. state in area and the 22nd most populous, with over 5.75 million residents. Minnesota is known as the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\" but actually has 14,380 bodies of fresh water covering at least ten acres each; roughly a third of the state is forested; much of the remainder is prairie and farmland. More than 60% of Minnesotans live in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, known as the \"Twin Cities\", the state's main political, economic, and cultural hub and the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. Other minor metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas include Duluth, Mankato, Moorhead, Rochester, and St. Cloud.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Minnesota"},{"type":"standard","title":"Minnesota_Territory","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Minnesota Territory</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1530285","titles":{"canonical":"Minnesota_Territory","normalized":"Minnesota Territory","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Minnesota Territory</span>"},"pageid":454194,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Location_of_Minnesota_Territory_with_current_U.S._state_boundaries.svg/320px-Location_of_Minnesota_Territory_with_current_U.S._state_boundaries.svg.png","width":320,"height":198},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Location_of_Minnesota_Territory_with_current_U.S._state_boundaries.svg/512px-Location_of_Minnesota_Territory_with_current_U.S._state_boundaries.svg.png","width":512,"height":317},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1208972740","tid":"91c881b4-cf57-11ee-8056-6c64e5e014d4","timestamp":"2024-02-19T18:49:11Z","description":"United States territory from 1849 to 1858, part of which became the state of Minnesota","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":46,"lon":-97.4},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Territory","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Territory?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Territory?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Minnesota_Territory"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Territory","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Minnesota_Territory","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Territory?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Minnesota_Territory"}},"extract":"The Territory of Minnesota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 3, 1849, until May 11, 1858, when the eastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Minnesota and the western portion became unorganized territory and shortly after was reorganized as part of the Dakota Territory.","extract_html":"<p>The <b>Territory of Minnesota</b> was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 3, 1849, until May 11, 1858, when the eastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Minnesota and the western portion became unorganized territory and shortly after was reorganized as part of the Dakota Territory.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Minnesota Territory"}],"year":1858},{"text":"William Lawson, Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth departed westward from Sydney on an expedition to become the first confirmed Europeans to cross the Blue Mountains (depicted).","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"William_Lawson_(explorer)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">William Lawson (explorer)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q249724","titles":{"canonical":"William_Lawson_(explorer)","normalized":"William Lawson (explorer)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">William Lawson (explorer)</span>"},"pageid":319443,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Portrait_of_William_Lawson.jpg/320px-Portrait_of_William_Lawson.jpg","width":320,"height":393},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Portrait_of_William_Lawson.jpg","width":620,"height":762},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1195383909","tid":"fb57b1a7-b232-11ee-bd4d-5de62dce9ee8","timestamp":"2024-01-13T16:44:13Z","description":"English born Australian explorer and politician (1774–1850)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawson_(explorer)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawson_(explorer)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawson_(explorer)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:William_Lawson_(explorer)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawson_(explorer)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/William_Lawson_(explorer)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawson_(explorer)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:William_Lawson_(explorer)"}},"extract":"William Lawson, MLC was a British soldier, explorer, land owner, grazier and politician who migrated to Sydney, New South Wales in 1800.
