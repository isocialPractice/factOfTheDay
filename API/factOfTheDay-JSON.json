It formed about 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun, a yellow dwarf star, and a protoplanetary disc from which all other Solar System bodies formed. The fusion of hydrogen into helium inside the Sun releases energy, which is partially emitted through the photosphere into the Solar System. This creates a temperature profile of the Solar System with a habitable zone, in which Earth orbits, and a frost line at about five astronomical units (AU), at the border between the inner Solar System with its terrestrial planets and the outer Solar System with its giant planets.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Solar System"}],"story":"<!--Jul 01-->Astronomers announce the discovery of <b id=\"mwCw\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./3I/ATLAS\" title=\"3I/ATLAS\" id=\"mwDA\">3I/ATLAS</a></b>, an <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Interstellar_object\" title=\"Interstellar object\" id=\"mwDQ\">interstellar object</a> passing through the <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Solar_System\" title=\"Solar System\" id=\"mwDg\">Solar System</a>."},{"links":[{"type":"standard","title":"Vera_C._Rubin_Observatory","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Vera C.

The movement of large numbers of people was a major factor in the deadly Spanish flu pandemic.</p>","normalizedtitle":"World War I"},{"type":"standard","title":"Kléber_Dupuy","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Kléber Dupuy</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q61927981","titles":{"canonical":"Kléber_Dupuy","normalized":"Kléber Dupuy","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Kléber Dupuy</span>"},"pageid":72164391,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/32/Kl%C3%A9ber_Dupuy.jpg","width":200,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/32/Kl%C3%A9ber_Dupuy.jpg","width":200,"height":320},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1291911681","tid":"67e6b933-3856-11f0-b65d-af1eba6648b1","timestamp":"2025-05-24T04:20:21Z","description":"French army officer (1892–1996)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kl%C3%A9ber_Dupuy","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kl%C3%A9ber_Dupuy?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kl%C3%A9ber_Dupuy?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kl%C3%A9ber_Dupuy"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kl%C3%A9ber_Dupuy","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Kl%C3%A9ber_Dupuy","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kl%C3%A9ber_Dupuy?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kl%C3%A9ber_Dupuy"}},"extract":"Kléber Dupuy was a French army officer.
