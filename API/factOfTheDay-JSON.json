The raids were orchestrated by Diệm's brother Ngô Đình Nhu and precipitated a change in US policy. The cable declared that Washington would no longer tolerate Nhu remaining in a position of power and ordered Lodge to pressure Diệm to remove his brother. It said that if Diệm refused, the Americans would explore the possibility for alternative leadership in South Vietnam. In effect, the cable authorized Lodge to give the green light to Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) officers to launch a coup against Diệm if he did not willingly remove Nhu from power. The cable marked a turning point in US-Diem relations and was described in the Pentagon Papers as \"controversial.\" The historian John M. Newman described it as \"the single most controversial cable of the Vietnam War.\"</p>","normalizedtitle":"Cable 243"},{"type":"standard","title":"Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr.","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q450984","titles":{"canonical":"Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr.","normalized":"Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.</span>"},"pageid":153062,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr_%28R-MA%29.jpg/320px-Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr_%28R-MA%29.jpg","width":320,"height":400},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr_%28R-MA%29.jpg","width":2241,"height":2801},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1241783701","tid":"0befe4d1-60fe-11ef-9502-ae270bc6b0b0","timestamp":"2024-08-23T03:16:11Z","description":"American politician and diplomat (1902–1985)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr.","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr.?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr.?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr."},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr.","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr.","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr.?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr."}},"extract":"Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. was an American diplomat and politician who represented Massachusetts in the United States Senate and served as United States Ambassador to the United Nations in the administration of President Dwight D.
