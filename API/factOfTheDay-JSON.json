In 2023, Julio Rodríguez set the single-round home run record with 41 homers, topping Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s 40 home runs in 2019.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Home Run Derby"},{"views":75220,"rank":21,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-07-11Z","views":82404},{"date":"2025-07-12Z","views":90018},{"date":"2025-07-13Z","views":94670},{"date":"2025-07-14Z","views":83777},{"date":"2025-07-15Z","views":75220}],"type":"standard","title":"KPop_Demon_Hunters","displaytitle":"<i>KPop Demon Hunters</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q130268157","titles":{"canonical":"KPop_Demon_Hunters","normalized":"KPop Demon Hunters","display":"<i>KPop Demon Hunters</i>"},"pageid":67104864,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/KPDHposter.jpeg","width":259,"height":384},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/KPDHposter.jpeg","width":259,"height":384},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1300665877","tid":"dafe0c24-61a7-11f0-98cd-e1220b504bd9","timestamp":"2025-07-15T18:16:41Z","description":"Animated film by Chris Appelhans and Maggie Kang","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPop_Demon_Hunters","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPop_Demon_Hunters?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPop_Demon_Hunters?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:KPop_Demon_Hunters"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPop_Demon_Hunters","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/KPop_Demon_Hunters","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPop_Demon_Hunters?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:KPop_Demon_Hunters"}},"extract":"KPop Demon Hunters is a 2025 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Sony Pictures Animation and released by Netflix.

Besides the decorative benefit, roof plantings may provide food, temperature control, hydrological benefits, architectural enhancement, habitats or corridors for wildlife, recreational opportunities, and in large scale it may even have ecological benefits. The practice of cultivating food on the rooftop of buildings is sometimes referred to as rooftop farming. Rooftop farming is usually done using green roof, hydroponics, aeroponics or air-dynaponics systems or container gardens.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Roof garden"}],"year":2004},{"text":"Fragments of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 began colliding with the planet Jupiter , with the first impact causing a fireball that reached a peak temperature of 24,000 kelvin.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Comet_Shoemaker–Levy_9","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3076","titles":{"canonical":"Comet_Shoemaker–Levy_9","normalized":"Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9</span>"},"pageid":6794,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1299866751","tid":"7de60d4c-5dd9-11f0-9a80-12355d151417","timestamp":"2025-07-10T22:01:55Z","description":"Comet that collided with Jupiter","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9"}},"extract":"Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 was a comet that broke apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects.
