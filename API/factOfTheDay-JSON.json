Fermi was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and for the discovery of transuranium elements. With his colleagues, Fermi filed several patents related to the use of nuclear power, all of which were taken over by the US government. He made significant contributions to the development of statistical mechanics, quantum theory, and nuclear and particle physics.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Enrico Fermi"},{"type":"standard","title":"Neutron_activation","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Neutron activation</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q901707","titles":{"canonical":"Neutron_activation","normalized":"Neutron activation","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Neutron activation</span>"},"pageid":1767692,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Quark_structure_neutron.svg/330px-Quark_structure_neutron.svg.png","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Quark_structure_neutron.svg/800px-Quark_structure_neutron.svg.png","width":800,"height":800},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1282071796","tid":"bcbf98dd-0861-11f0-b299-ca900e471d4b","timestamp":"2025-03-24T03:40:32Z","description":"Induction of radioactivity by neutron radiation","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_activation","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_activation?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_activation?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neutron_activation"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_activation","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Neutron_activation","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_activation?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neutron_activation"}},"extract":"Neutron activation is the process in which neutron radiation induces radioactivity in materials, and occurs when atomic nuclei capture free neutrons, becoming heavier and entering excited states.
