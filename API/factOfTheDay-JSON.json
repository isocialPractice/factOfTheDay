Escobar's main partner in the organization was his cousin Gustavo Gaviria, who handled much of the cartel's shipping arrangements and the more general and detailed logistical aspects of the cocaine trafficking routes and international smuggling networks, which were supplying at least 80% of the world's cocaine during its peak.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Medellín Cartel"},{"type":"standard","title":"César_Gaviria","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">César Gaviria</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q332020","titles":{"canonical":"César_Gaviria","normalized":"César Gaviria","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">César Gaviria</span>"},"pageid":162749,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/C%C3%A9sar_Gaviria%2C_World_Economic_Forum_on_Latin_America_2009_%28cropped%29.jpg/320px-C%C3%A9sar_Gaviria%2C_World_Economic_Forum_on_Latin_America_2009_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/C%C3%A9sar_Gaviria%2C_World_Economic_Forum_on_Latin_America_2009_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":2914,"height":2912},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1258058963","tid":"95fed998-a539-11ef-89c1-1970d63c3d47","timestamp":"2024-11-17T23:13:42Z","description":"Colombian economist and politician (born 1947)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Gaviria","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Gaviria?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Gaviria?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:C%C3%A9sar_Gaviria"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Gaviria","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/C%C3%A9sar_Gaviria","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Gaviria?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:C%C3%A9sar_Gaviria"}},"extract":"César Augusto Gaviria Trujillo is a Colombian economist and politician who served as the President of Colombia from 1990 to 1994, Secretary General of the Organization of American States from 1994 to 2004 and National Director of the Colombian Liberal Party from 2005 to 2009.

Prizes were first awarded in 1901 by the Nobel Foundation. Nobel's will indicated that the awards should be granted in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace. A sixth prize for Economic Sciences, endowed by Sweden's central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, and first presented in 1969, is also frequently included, as it is also administered by the Nobel Foundation.
