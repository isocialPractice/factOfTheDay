The Estonian SSR was nominally established to replace the until then independent Republic of Estonia on 21 July 1940, a month after the 16–17 June 1940 Soviet military invasion and occupation of the country during World War II. After the installation of a Stalinist government which, backed by the occupying Soviet Red Army, declared Estonia a Soviet constituency, the Estonian SSR was subsequently incorporated into the Soviet Union as a union republic on 6 August 1940. Estonia was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941, and administered as a part of <i>Reichskommissariat Ostland</i> until it was reconquered by the USSR in 1944.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic"},{"type":"standard","title":"Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q192180","titles":{"canonical":"Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","normalized":"Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic</span>"},"pageid":380350,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic_%281953%E2%80%931990%29.svg/320px-Flag_of_the_Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic_%281953%E2%80%931990%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":160},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic_%281953%E2%80%931990%29.svg/1200px-Flag_of_the_Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic_%281953%E2%80%931990%29.svg.png","width":1200,"height":600},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1238798585","tid":"5a118de8-535b-11ef-89b0-549918c6a707","timestamp":"2024-08-05T18:48:49Z","description":"Constituent republic of the Soviet Union (1940–1941; 1944–1990)","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":56.9667,"lon":24.1333},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Latvian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic"}},"extract":"The Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, also known as Soviet Latvia or simply Latvia, was de facto one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union between 1940–1941 and 1944–1990.","extract_html":"<p>The <b>Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic</b>, also known as <b>Soviet Latvia</b> or simply <b>Latvia</b>, was <i>de facto</i> one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union between 1940–1941 and 1944–1990.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic"},{"type":"standard","title":"Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q173761","titles":{"canonical":"Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","normalized":"Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic</span>"},"pageid":404449,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Flag_of_the_Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic_%281953%E2%80%931988%29.svg/320px-Flag_of_the_Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic_%281953%E2%80%931988%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":160},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Flag_of_the_Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic_%281953%E2%80%931988%29.svg/1200px-Flag_of_the_Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic_%281953%E2%80%931988%29.svg.png","width":1200,"height":600},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1239148275","tid":"c7e2ca9a-54d7-11ef-b37c-5b7c21cff7d4","timestamp":"2024-08-07T16:12:02Z","description":"Constituent republic of the Soviet Union (1940–1941; 1944–1990)","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":55.5,"lon":24},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic"}},"extract":"The Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, also known as Soviet Lithuania or simply Lithuania, was de facto one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union between 1940–1941 and 1944–1990.

be hanged, drawn and quartered became a statutory penalty for men convicted of high treason in the Kingdom of England from 1352 under King Edward III (1327–1377), although similar rituals are recorded during the reign of King Henry III (1216–1272). The convicted traitor was fastened to a hurdle, or wooden panel, and drawn behind a horse to the place of execution, where he was then hanged, emasculated, disembowelled, beheaded, and quartered. His remains would then often be displayed in prominent places across the country, such as London Bridge, to serve as a warning of the fate of traitors.
