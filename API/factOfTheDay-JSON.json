The current governor is Gavin Newsom, who has been in office since 2019. 39 people have served as governor, over 40 distinct terms. Many have been influential nationwide in areas far-flung from state politics. Leland Stanford founded Stanford University in 1891. Earl Warren, later chief justice of the United States, won an election with the nominations of the three major parties – the only person to run essentially unopposed for governor of California. Ronald Reagan, who was president of the Screen Actors Guild and later president of the United States, and Arnold Schwarzenegger both came to prominence through acting. Gray Davis, the 37th governor of California, was the second governor in American history to be recalled by voters. The shortest tenure was that of Milton Latham, who served only five days before being elected to fill a vacant United States Senate seat. The longest tenure is that of Jerry Brown, who served as governor from 1975 to 1983 and again from 2011 to 2019, the only governor to serve non-consecutive terms. He is the son of former governor Pat Brown who served from 1959 to 1967.</p>","normalizedtitle":"List of governors of California"}],"year":1967},{"text":"Vietnam War: The Viet Cong won its first major victory at the Battle of Ap Bac.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Vietnam_War","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Vietnam War</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q8740","titles":{"canonical":"Vietnam_War","normalized":"Vietnam War","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Vietnam War</span>"},"pageid":32611,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/U.S._Army_UH-1H_Hueys_insert_ARVN_troops_at_Kh%C3%A2m_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c%2C_Vietnam%2C_12_July_1970_%2879431435%29.jpg/320px-U.S._Army_UH-1H_Hueys_insert_ARVN_troops_at_Kh%C3%A2m_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c%2C_Vietnam%2C_12_July_1970_%2879431435%29.jpg","width":320,"height":196},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/U.S._Army_UH-1H_Hueys_insert_ARVN_troops_at_Kh%C3%A2m_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c%2C_Vietnam%2C_12_July_1970_%2879431435%29.jpg","width":1085,"height":664},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1266729099","tid":"ca392c22-c89b-11ef-a582-46702360c116","timestamp":"2025-01-01T23:54:51Z","description":"War in Southeast Asia from 1955 to 1975","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vietnam_War"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Vietnam_War","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vietnam_War"}},"extract":"The Vietnam War was an armed conflict in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia fought between North Vietnam and South Vietnam and their allies.
