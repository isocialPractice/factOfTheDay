It was not classified as a war crime at the time, but since then, some historians have classified it as a genocide due to the intentional destruction of the city and the systematic starvation of its civilian population.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Siege of Leningrad"}],"year":1943},{"text":"Japanese prime minister Ōkuma Shigenobu issued the Twenty-One Demands to China in a bid to increase Japan's power in East Asia.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Ōkuma_Shigenobu","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ōkuma Shigenobu</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q243141","titles":{"canonical":"Ōkuma_Shigenobu","normalized":"Ōkuma Shigenobu","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ōkuma Shigenobu</span>"},"pageid":174110,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Shigenobu_Okuma_2_%28cropped%29.JPG/330px-Shigenobu_Okuma_2_%28cropped%29.JPG","width":320,"height":427},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Shigenobu_Okuma_2_%28cropped%29.JPG","width":650,"height":868},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1320475681","tid":"c51e8ede-b9ce-11f0-8f2d-f4cb4cad4e89","timestamp":"2025-11-04T22:36:57Z","description":"Prime Minister of Japan (1898, 1914–1916)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Ckuma_Shigenobu","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Ckuma_Shigenobu?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Ckuma_Shigenobu?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:%C5%8Ckuma_Shigenobu"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Ckuma_Shigenobu","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/%C5%8Ckuma_Shigenobu","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Ckuma_Shigenobu?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:%C5%8Ckuma_Shigenobu"}},"extract":"Marquess Ōkuma Shigenobu was a Japanese statesman who was a leading figure in the Meiji and Taishō eras of Japan, serving as Prime Minister in 1898, and from 1914 to 1916.
