The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup; the Euro 2016 final was watched by a global audience of around 600 million. The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the <b>European Nations' Cup</b> before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"<b>UEFA Euro [year]</b>\".</p>","normalizedtitle":"UEFA European Championship"},{"views":78720,"rank":33,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-06-23Z","views":128700},{"date":"2024-06-24Z","views":246590},{"date":"2024-06-25Z","views":134615},{"date":"2024-06-26Z","views":100444},{"date":"2024-06-27Z","views":78720}],"type":"standard","title":"House_of_the_Dragon","displaytitle":"<i>House of the Dragon</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q72930269","titles":{"canonical":"House_of_the_Dragon","normalized":"House of the Dragon","display":"<i>House of the Dragon</i>"},"pageid":62195577,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1231403149","tid":"bcc06394-34f9-11ef-af20-32e3a93717de","timestamp":"2024-06-28T02:54:29Z","description":"American fantasy TV series","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:House_of_the_Dragon"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/House_of_the_Dragon","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:House_of_the_Dragon"}},"extract":"House of the Dragon is an American fantasy drama television series created by George R.

While most water ice is buried, it is exposed at the surface across several locations on Mars. In the mid-latitudes, it is exposed by impact craters, steep scarps and gullies. Additionally, water ice is also visible at the surface at the north polar ice cap. Abundant water ice is also present beneath the permanent carbon dioxide ice cap at the Martian south pole.

Geologic evidence of past water includes enormous outflow channels carved by floods, ancient river valley networks, deltas, and lakebeds; and the detection of rocks and minerals on the surface that could only have formed in liquid water. Numerous geomorphic features suggest the presence of ground ice (permafrost) and the movement of ice in glaciers, both in the recent past and present. Gullies and slope lineae along cliffs and crater walls suggest that flowing water continues to shape the surface of Mars, although to a far lesser degree than in the ancient past.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Water on Mars"},{"type":"standard","title":"Abu_Hummus","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Abu Hummus</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q4165804","titles":{"canonical":"Abu_Hummus","normalized":"Abu Hummus","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Abu Hummus</span>"},"pageid":37785018,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%B2_%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%88_%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%B5.png/320px-%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%B2_%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%88_%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%B5.png","width":320,"height":482},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%B2_%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%88_%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%B5.png","width":762,"height":1147},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1219405060","tid":"55ec3c0a-fcd0-11ee-834b-904fa2afb926","timestamp":"2024-04-17T15:37:02Z","description":"Town in Beheira Governorate, Egypt","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":31.10055556,"lon":30.31277778},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Hummus","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Hummus?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Hummus?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Abu_Hummus"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Hummus","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Abu_Hummus","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Hummus?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Abu_Hummus"}},"extract":"Abu Hummus, also Abu Humus, Abu Hommos, Abu Homos, Abou Homs is a town in Beheira Governorate, Egypt, an administrative center of markaz Abu Hummus.","extract_html":"<p><b>Abu Hummus</b>, also <b>Abu Humus</b>, <b>Abu Hommos</b>, <b>Abu Homos</b>, <b>Abou Homs</b> is a town in Beheira Governorate, Egypt, an administrative center of <i>markaz</i> Abu Hummus.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Abu Hummus"}],"year":1911},{"text":"In the worst maritime disaster involving a Danish merchant ship, SS Norge ran aground on Hasselwood Rock and sank in the North Atlantic, resulting in more than 635 deaths.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"SS_Norge","displaytitle":"SS <i>Norge</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1376616","titles":{"canonical":"SS_Norge","normalized":"SS Norge","display":"SS <i>Norge</i>"},"pageid":2151881,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/SS_Norge.jpg/320px-SS_Norge.jpg","width":320,"height":230},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/SS_Norge.jpg","width":3466,"height":2488},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1225714714","tid":"55e131f3-1b2f-11ef-a138-26b09475ecd3","timestamp":"2024-05-26T07:12:39Z","description":"Danish passenger liner","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":57.5967,"lon":-13.6887},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Norge","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Norge?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Norge?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:SS_Norge"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Norge","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/SS_Norge","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Norge?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:SS_Norge"}},"extract":"SS Norge was a transatlantic ocean liner that was launched in 1881 in Scotland, and lost in 1904 off Rockall with great loss of life.
