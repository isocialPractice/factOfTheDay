Based on the 2005 biography <i>American Prometheus</i> by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles the career of Oppenheimer, with the story predominantly focusing on his studies, his direction of the Manhattan Project during World War II, and his eventual fall from grace due to his 1954 security hearing. The film also stars Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife \"Kitty\", Matt Damon as head of the Manhattan Project Leslie Groves, Robert Downey Jr. as United States Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss, and Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer's communist lover Jean Tatlock. The ensemble supporting cast includes Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Oppenheimer (film)"}]},"image":{"title":"File:Mont Blanc from Les Arcs 1950.jpg","thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Mont_Blanc_from_Les_Arcs_1950.jpg/640px-Mont_Blanc_from_Les_Arcs_1950.jpg","width":640,"height":360},"image":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Mont_Blanc_from_Les_Arcs_1950.jpg","width":5259,"height":2958},"file_page":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mont_Blanc_from_Les_Arcs_1950.jpg","artist":{"html":"<a href=\"//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Dmottl\" title=\"User:Dmottl\">Dmitry A.

Hostilities between the two countries ended after a ceasefire was declared through UNSC Resolution 211 following a diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States, and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration. Much of the war was fought by the countries' land forces in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan. This war saw the largest amassing of troops in Kashmir since the Partition of India in 1947, a number that was overshadowed only during the 2001–2002 military standoff between India and Pakistan. Most of the battles were fought by opposing infantry and armored units, with substantial backing from air forces, and naval operations.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Indo-Pakistani war of 1965"}],"year":1966},{"text":"The first session of the United Nations General Assembly convened at the Methodist Central Hall in London with representatives from 51 member states.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"United_Nations_General_Assembly","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">United Nations General Assembly</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q47423","titles":{"canonical":"United_Nations_General_Assembly","normalized":"United Nations General Assembly","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">United Nations General Assembly</span>"},"pageid":31957,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/UN_General_Assembly_hall.jpg/320px-UN_General_Assembly_hall.jpg","width":320,"height":199},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/UN_General_Assembly_hall.jpg","width":1920,"height":1191},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1187514544","tid":"a85c5a00-ae52-11ee-80a8-2f90f3287c43","timestamp":"2023-11-29T19:02:19Z","description":"One of the six principal organs of the United Nations","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:United_Nations_General_Assembly"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/United_Nations_General_Assembly","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:United_Nations_General_Assembly"}},"extract":"The United Nations General Assembly is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations (UN), serving as its main deliberative, policymaking, and representative organ.

Its task was to lay a series of supply depots across the Great Ice Barrier from the Ross Sea to the Beardmore Glacier, along the polar route established by earlier Antarctic expeditions. The expedition's main party, under Shackleton, was to land near Vahsel Bay on the Weddell Sea on the opposite coast of Antarctica, and to march across the continent via the South Pole to the Ross Sea. As the main party would be unable to carry sufficient fuel and supplies for the whole distance, their survival depended on the Ross Sea party setting up supply depots, which would cover the final quarter of their journey.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Ross Sea party"}],"year":1917},{"text":"The first great gusher of the Texas oil boom was discovered in the Spindletop oil field near Beaumont.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Blowout_(well_drilling)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Blowout (well drilling)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q885506","titles":{"canonical":"Blowout_(well_drilling)","normalized":"Blowout (well drilling)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Blowout (well drilling)</span>"},"pageid":5123117,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Lucas_gusher.jpg/320px-Lucas_gusher.jpg","width":320,"height":381},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Lucas_gusher.jpg","width":410,"height":488},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1192229031","tid":"0f12ae30-a560-11ee-9cc6-611cd38e6198","timestamp":"2023-12-28T09:04:04Z","description":"Uncontrolled release of crude oil and/or natural gas from a well","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowout_(well_drilling)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowout_(well_drilling)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowout_(well_drilling)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Blowout_(well_drilling)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowout_(well_drilling)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Blowout_(well_drilling)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowout_(well_drilling)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Blowout_(well_drilling)"}},"extract":"A blowout is the uncontrolled release of crude oil and/or natural gas from an oil well or gas well after pressure control systems have failed.

Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as \"MV\" for <i>motor vessel</i>, so it is not correct to use \"SS\" for most modern vessels.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Steamship"},{"type":"standard","title":"Mississippi_River","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mississippi River</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1497","titles":{"canonical":"Mississippi_River","normalized":"Mississippi River","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mississippi River</span>"},"pageid":19579,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Efmo_View_from_Fire_Point.jpg/320px-Efmo_View_from_Fire_Point.jpg","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Efmo_View_from_Fire_Point.jpg","width":900,"height":675},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1187145574","tid":"84805be0-ae52-11ee-bd19-1514c8303b6e","timestamp":"2023-11-27T19:23:16Z","description":"Major river in the United States","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":29.15111111,"lon":-89.25333333},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mississippi_River"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Mississippi_River","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mississippi_River"}},"extract":"The Mississippi River is the primary river, and second-longest river, of the largest drainage basin in the United States.
