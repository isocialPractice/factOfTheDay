It is Neal's longest critical work and at least 120 authors are covered, based entirely on Neal's memory. With no notes or books for reference, Neal made multiple factually inaccurate claims and provided coverage of many authors that modern scholars criticize as disproportionate to their role in American literature.

Three moons are particularly notable. Titan is the second-largest moon in the Solar System, with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring river networks and hydrocarbon lakes. Enceladus emits jets of ice from its south-polar region and is covered in a deep layer of snow. Iapetus has contrasting black and white hemispheres as well as an extensive ridge of equatorial mountains among the tallest in the solar system.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Moons of Saturn"},{"type":"standard","title":"Janus_(moon)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Janus (moon)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q17754","titles":{"canonical":"Janus_(moon)","normalized":"Janus (moon)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Janus (moon)</span>"},"pageid":159853,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/PIA12714_Janus_crop.jpg/320px-PIA12714_Janus_crop.jpg","width":320,"height":266},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/PIA12714_Janus_crop.jpg","width":988,"height":822},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1247115382","tid":"f6551291-792e-11ef-b66b-e714986a4dab","timestamp":"2024-09-22T22:06:48Z","description":"Moon of Saturn","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_(moon)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_(moon)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_(moon)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Janus_(moon)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_(moon)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Janus_(moon)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_(moon)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Janus_(moon)"}},"extract":"Janus is an inner satellite of Saturn.
