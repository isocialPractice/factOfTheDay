Modern Thai <i>lèse-majesté</i> law has been on the statute books since 1908. Thailand is the only constitutional monarchy to have strengthened its <i>lèse-majesté</i> law since the Second World War. With penalties ranging from three to fifteen years imprisonment for each count, it has been described as the \"world's harshest <i>lèse majesté</i> law\" and \"possibly the strictest criminal-defamation law anywhere\". Its enforcement has been described as being \"in the interest of the palace\".</p>","normalizedtitle":"Lèse-majesté in Thailand"},{"type":"standard","title":"Insult_(legal)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Insult (legal)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3086119","titles":{"canonical":"Insult_(legal)","normalized":"Insult (legal)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Insult (legal)</span>"},"pageid":63547532,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Legal_status_of_insult.png/320px-Legal_status_of_insult.png","width":320,"height":142},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Legal_status_of_insult.png","width":7188,"height":3188},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1262383965","tid":"20b7a963-b76d-11ef-8231-7fc50f2da065","timestamp":"2024-12-11T03:08:00Z","description":"Infringement of another human's honor","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insult_(legal)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insult_(legal)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insult_(legal)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Insult_(legal)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insult_(legal)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Insult_(legal)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insult_(legal)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Insult_(legal)"}},"extract":"Insult is the infringement of another human's honor by whatsoever means of expression, in particular an offensive statement or gesture communicated, and is a crime in some countries.

The United States Army considers itself a continuation of the Continental Army, and thus considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775.</p>","normalizedtitle":"United States Army"},{"type":"standard","title":"Chenogne_massacre","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Chenogne massacre</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q4090467","titles":{"canonical":"Chenogne_massacre","normalized":"Chenogne massacre","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Chenogne massacre</span>"},"pageid":5579657,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1265091359","tid":"aa816f00-c261-11ef-a0d5-56781746460d","timestamp":"2024-12-25T01:43:40Z","description":"WWII war crime","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":49.992,"lon":5.618},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenogne_massacre","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenogne_massacre?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenogne_massacre?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chenogne_massacre"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenogne_massacre","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Chenogne_massacre","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenogne_massacre?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chenogne_massacre"}},"extract":"The Chenogne massacre was a war crime committed by members of the 11th Armored Division, an American combat unit, near Chenogne, Belgium, on January 1, 1945, during the Battle of the Bulge.","extract_html":"<p>The <b>Chenogne massacre</b> was a war crime committed by members of the 11th Armored Division, an American combat unit, near Chenogne, Belgium, on January 1, 1945, during the Battle of the Bulge.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Chenogne massacre"},{"type":"standard","title":"Wehrmacht","displaytitle":"<i>Wehrmacht</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q128781","titles":{"canonical":"Wehrmacht","normalized":"Wehrmacht","display":"<i>Wehrmacht</i>"},"pageid":21376046,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/War_Ensign_of_Germany_%281938%E2%80%931945%29.svg/320px-War_Ensign_of_Germany_%281938%E2%80%931945%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":192},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/War_Ensign_of_Germany_%281938%E2%80%931945%29.svg/1000px-War_Ensign_of_Germany_%281938%E2%80%931945%29.svg.png","width":1000,"height":600},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1266541741","tid":"272be23a-c7f1-11ef-9816-7159139f67c2","timestamp":"2025-01-01T03:33:23Z","description":"Unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wehrmacht"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Wehrmacht","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wehrmacht"}},"extract":"The Wehrmacht were the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945.

In an analogous way to the Governor-General of Australia at the national level, the Governors of the Australian States perform constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level. The governor is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Premier of New South Wales, and serves in office for an unfixed period of time—known as serving <i>At His Majesty's pleasure</i>—though five years is the general standard of office term.
