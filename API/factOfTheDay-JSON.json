These populations exhibit significant diversity; some Indigenous peoples were historically hunter-gatherers, while others practiced agriculture and aquaculture. Various Indigenous societies developed complex social structures, including pre-contact monumental architecture, organized cities, city-states, chiefdoms, states, kingdoms, republics, confederacies, and empires. These societies possessed varying levels of knowledge in fields such as engineering, architecture, mathematics, astronomy, writing, physics, medicine, agriculture, irrigation, geology, mining, metallurgy, sculpture, and goldsmithing.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas"}],"year":1763},{"text":"Ottoman–Habsburg wars: The Battle of Lepanto was fought near the Gulf of Corinth, a significant setback for the Ottoman Empire and the last major naval battle fought entirely with galleys.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Ottoman–Habsburg_wars","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ottoman–Habsburg wars</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q786171","titles":{"canonical":"Ottoman–Habsburg_wars","normalized":"Ottoman–Habsburg wars","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ottoman–Habsburg wars</span>"},"pageid":11823525,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/MixCollage-15-Jan-2024-09-37-PM-7066.jpg/320px-MixCollage-15-Jan-2024-09-37-PM-7066.jpg","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/MixCollage-15-Jan-2024-09-37-PM-7066.jpg","width":3000,"height":3000},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1249401113","tid":"38138501-8280-11ef-900b-5b031f05c543","timestamp":"2024-10-04T18:41:08Z","description":"1526–1791 series of wars in Europe","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars"}},"extract":"The Ottoman–Habsburg wars were fought from the 16th to the 18th centuries between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg monarchy, which was at times supported by the Kingdom of Hungary, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and Habsburg Spain.
