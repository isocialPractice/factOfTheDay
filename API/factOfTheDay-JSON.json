The Project asserts that the entire executive branch is under the direct control of the president under the unitary executive theory. It proposes reclassifying tens of thousands of federal civil service workers as political appointees, in order to replace them with loyalists more willing to enable Trump's policies. In doing so, proponents argue that the change would dismantle what they view as a vast, unaccountable, and mostly liberal government bureaucracy. The Project seeks to infuse the government and society with Christian values.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is responsible for organising the Games and for overseeing the host city's preparations. The tradition of awarding medals began in 1904; in each Olympic event, gold medals are awarded for first place, silver medals for second place, and bronze medals for third place. The Winter Olympic Games were created out of the success of the Summer Olympic Games, which are regarded as the largest and most prestigious multi-sport international event in the world.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Summer Olympic Games"},{"views":98493,"rank":30,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-07-22Z","views":310882},{"date":"2024-07-23Z","views":254046},{"date":"2024-07-24Z","views":154575},{"date":"2024-07-25Z","views":120970},{"date":"2024-07-26Z","views":98493}],"type":"standard","title":"2024_United_States_presidential_election","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">2024 United States presidential election</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q101110072","titles":{"canonical":"2024_United_States_presidential_election","normalized":"2024 United States presidential election","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">2024 United States presidential election</span>"},"pageid":59568546,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/ElectoralCollege2024.svg/320px-ElectoralCollege2024.svg.png","width":320,"height":186},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/ElectoralCollege2024.svg/1020px-ElectoralCollege2024.svg.png","width":1020,"height":593},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1236890963","tid":"1f706846-4bc1-11ef-8733-55acf1ac3ac5","timestamp":"2024-07-27T02:37:10Z","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2024_United_States_presidential_election"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/2024_United_States_presidential_election","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2024_United_States_presidential_election"}},"extract":"The 2024 United States presidential election will be the 60th quadrennial presidential election, set to be held on Tuesday, November 5, 2024.

The crash took place amid highly strained relations between the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc and was the deadliest involving the Constellation up to that time.</p>","normalizedtitle":"El Al Flight 402"},{"type":"standard","title":"Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-15","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q187377","titles":{"canonical":"Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-15","normalized":"Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15</span>"},"pageid":182690,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Duxford_Air_Festival_2017_-_mig1_%2834842016051%29.jpg/320px-Duxford_Air_Festival_2017_-_mig1_%2834842016051%29.jpg","width":320,"height":211},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Duxford_Air_Festival_2017_-_mig1_%2834842016051%29.jpg","width":1504,"height":994},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1236620510","tid":"9e746b36-4aad-11ef-bc1b-7376a0b84719","timestamp":"2024-07-25T17:45:02Z","description":"Soviet fighter aircraft","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-15","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-15?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-15?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-15"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-15","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-15","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-15?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-15"}},"extract":"The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 is a jet fighter aircraft developed by Mikoyan-Gurevich for the Soviet Union.
