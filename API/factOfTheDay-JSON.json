By March 1800 Valletta, the Maltese capital, had been under siege for eighteen months and food supplies were severely depleted, a problem exacerbated by the interception and defeat of a French replenishment convoy in mid-February. In an effort to simultaneously obtain help from France and reduce the number of personnel maintained in the city, the naval commander on the island, Contre-amiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, ordered his subordinate Contre-amiral Denis Decrès to put to sea with the large ship of the line <span><i>Guillaume Tell</i></span>, which had arrived in the port shortly before the siege began in September 1798. Over 900 men were carried aboard the ship, which was to sail for Toulon under cover of darkness on 30 March.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Action of 31 March 1800"},{"type":"standard","title":"HMS_Malta_(1800)","displaytitle":"HMS <i>Malta</i> (1800)","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3223431","titles":{"canonical":"HMS_Malta_(1800)","normalized":"HMS Malta (1800)","display":"HMS <i>Malta</i> (1800)"},"pageid":23641231,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Guillaume_Tell_PU5634.jpg/320px-Guillaume_Tell_PU5634.jpg","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Guillaume_Tell_PU5634.jpg","width":540,"height":359},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1205041143","tid":"63e5dee0-d2ca-11ee-81ed-fb63870e81bd","timestamp":"2024-02-08T18:19:40Z","description":"Ship of the line of the Royal Navy","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Malta_(1800)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Malta_(1800)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Malta_(1800)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:HMS_Malta_(1800)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Malta_(1800)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/HMS_Malta_(1800)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Malta_(1800)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:HMS_Malta_(1800)"}},"extract":"HMS Malta was an 80-gun third rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy.
