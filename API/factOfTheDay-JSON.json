World War II was the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70 to 85 million deaths, more than half being civilians. Millions died in genocides, including the Holocaust of European Jews, as well as from massacres, starvation, and disease. Following the Allied powers' victory, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.</p>","normalizedtitle":"World War II"},{"type":"standard","title":"Luftwaffe","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Luftwaffe</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2564009","titles":{"canonical":"Luftwaffe","normalized":"Luftwaffe","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Luftwaffe</span>"},"pageid":17885,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/COA_Luftwaffe_eagle_silver_%28looking_left%29.svg/320px-COA_Luftwaffe_eagle_silver_%28looking_left%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":188},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/COA_Luftwaffe_eagle_silver_%28looking_left%29.svg/512px-COA_Luftwaffe_eagle_silver_%28looking_left%29.svg.png","width":512,"height":301},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1259588688","tid":"e43e6736-ab87-11ef-a2cd-faf81dd76364","timestamp":"2024-11-25T23:49:21Z","description":"Branch of the German military during World War II","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Luftwaffe"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Luftwaffe","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Luftwaffe"}},"extract":"The Luftwaffe was the aerial-warfare branch of the Wehrmacht before and during World War II.

When a fissile nucleus like uranium-235 or plutonium-239 absorbs a neutron, it splits into lighter nuclei, releasing energy, gamma radiation, and free neutrons, which can induce further fission in a self-sustaining chain reaction. The process is carefully controlled using control rods and neutron moderators to regulate the number of neutrons that continue the reaction, ensuring the reactor operates safely, although inherent control by means of delayed neutrons also plays an important role in reactor output control. The efficiency of nuclear fuel is much higher than fossil fuels; the 5% enriched uranium used in the newest reactors has an energy density 120,000 times higher than coal.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Nuclear reactor"},{"type":"standard","title":"Chicago_Pile-1","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Chicago Pile-1</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q284681","titles":{"canonical":"Chicago_Pile-1","normalized":"Chicago Pile-1","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Chicago Pile-1</span>"},"pageid":1118396,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Stagg_Field_reactor.jpg/320px-Stagg_Field_reactor.jpg","width":320,"height":251},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Stagg_Field_reactor.jpg","width":3000,"height":2352},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1259892939","tid":"8b84d8da-ace5-11ef-82c4-f1d65bced920","timestamp":"2024-11-27T17:32:16Z","description":"World's first human-made nuclear reactor","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":41.7925,"lon":-87.60111111},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chicago_Pile-1"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Chicago_Pile-1","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chicago_Pile-1"}},"extract":"Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1) was the world's first artificial nuclear reactor.
