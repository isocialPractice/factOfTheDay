Following the Allied powers' victory, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.</p>","normalizedtitle":"World War II"},{"type":"standard","title":"Nazi_Germany","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Nazi Germany</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q7318","titles":{"canonical":"Nazi_Germany","normalized":"Nazi Germany","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Nazi Germany</span>"},"pageid":21212,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Flag_of_Germany_%281935%E2%80%931945%29.svg/320px-Flag_of_Germany_%281935%E2%80%931945%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":192},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Flag_of_Germany_%281935%E2%80%931945%29.svg/1000px-Flag_of_Germany_%281935%E2%80%931945%29.svg.png","width":1000,"height":600},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1245653567","tid":"1113f079-7276-11ef-b877-1006ff0585c4","timestamp":"2024-09-14T08:48:09Z","description":"Germany under the Nazi Party (1933–1945)","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":52.52,"lon":13.37},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nazi_Germany"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Nazi_Germany","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nazi_Germany"}},"extract":"Nazi Germany, officially known as the German Reich and later the Greater German Reich, was the German state between 1933 and 1945, when Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party controlled the country, transforming it into a totalitarian dictatorship.
