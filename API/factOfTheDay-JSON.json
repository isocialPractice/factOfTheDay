The line built by the company, which opened in 1837, linked the Liverpool and Manchester Railway to Birmingham via Warrington, Crewe, Stafford and Wolverhampton. This was the first trunk railway to be completed in England, and arguably the world's first long-distance railway with steam traction. It terminated at Curzon Street Station in Birmingham, which it shared with the London and Birmingham Railway (L&amp;BR), whose adjacent platforms gave an interchange with full connectivity between Liverpool, Manchester and London.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Grand Junction Railway"},{"type":"standard","title":"Traction_engine","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Traction engine</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q63531700","titles":{"canonical":"Traction_engine","normalized":"Traction engine","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Traction engine</span>"},"pageid":517490,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/General_Purpose_Engine_BJ_7155_GDSF.JPG/330px-General_Purpose_Engine_BJ_7155_GDSF.JPG","width":320,"height":241},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/General_Purpose_Engine_BJ_7155_GDSF.JPG","width":4169,"height":3145},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1298647005","tid":"cc2e6434-5847-11f0-b103-312e21d99597","timestamp":"2025-07-03T19:56:24Z","description":"Steam-powered haulage engine","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_engine","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_engine?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_engine?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Traction_engine"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_engine","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Traction_engine","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_engine?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Traction_engine"}},"extract":"A traction engine is a steam-powered tractor used to move heavy loads on roads, plough ground or to provide power at a chosen location.
