It was later conceded by the modern Vietnamese communist leadership that the movement was actually under the North Vietnamese political and military leadership, aiming to unify Vietnam under a single banner.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Viet Cong"},{"type":"standard","title":"People's_Army_of_Vietnam","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">People&#039;s Army of Vietnam</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3936506","titles":{"canonical":"People's_Army_of_Vietnam","normalized":"People's Army of Vietnam","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">People&#039;s Army of Vietnam</span>"},"pageid":32384,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Emblem_VPA.svg/320px-Emblem_VPA.svg.png","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Emblem_VPA.svg/593px-Emblem_VPA.svg.png","width":593,"height":593},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1271451780","tid":"d8441a3f-d9ff-11ef-baa5-73f9df222434","timestamp":"2025-01-24T03:03:54Z","description":"Combined military forces of Vietnam","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Army_of_Vietnam","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Army_of_Vietnam?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Army_of_Vietnam?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:People's_Army_of_Vietnam"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Army_of_Vietnam","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/People's_Army_of_Vietnam","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Army_of_Vietnam?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:People's_Army_of_Vietnam"}},"extract":"The People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), officially the Vietnam People's Army, also recognized as the Vietnamese Army, the People's Army or colloquially the Troops, is the national military force of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the armed wing of the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV).
