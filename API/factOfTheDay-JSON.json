When aircraft first approached the speed of sound, these effects were seen as constituting a barrier, making faster speeds very difficult or impossible. The term <i>sound barrier</i> is still sometimes used today to refer to aircraft approaching supersonic flight in this high drag regime. Flying faster than sound produces a sonic boom.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Sound barrier"},{"type":"standard","title":"Mach_number","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mach number</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q160669","titles":{"canonical":"Mach_number","normalized":"Mach number","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mach number</span>"},"pageid":20051,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/FA-18_Hornet_breaking_sound_barrier_%287_July_1999%29.jpg/330px-FA-18_Hornet_breaking_sound_barrier_%287_July_1999%29.jpg","width":320,"height":229},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/FA-18_Hornet_breaking_sound_barrier_%287_July_1999%29.jpg","width":2100,"height":1500},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1316546702","tid":"5428f256-a7df-11f0-8f1d-7f5dd774b6ed","timestamp":"2025-10-13T02:50:08Z","description":"Dimensionless quantity in fluid dynamics","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mach_number"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Mach_number","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mach_number"}},"extract":"The Mach number, often only Mach, is a dimensionless quantity in fluid dynamics representing the ratio of flow velocity past a boundary to the local speed of sound.\nIt is named after Austrian physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach.","extract_html":"<p>The <b>Mach number</b>, often only <b>Mach</b>, is a dimensionless quantity in fluid dynamics representing the ratio of flow velocity past a boundary to the local speed of sound.\nIt is named after Austrian physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Mach number"},{"type":"standard","title":"Bell_X-1","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Bell X-1</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q223365","titles":{"canonical":"Bell_X-1","normalized":"Bell X-1","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Bell X-1</span>"},"pageid":208674,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Bell_X-1_46-062_%28in_flight%29.jpg/330px-Bell_X-1_46-062_%28in_flight%29.jpg","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Bell_X-1_46-062_%28in_flight%29.jpg","width":2969,"height":2227},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1314059758","tid":"e72550fc-9d3e-11f0-a7a2-5bdbd67b9a81","timestamp":"2025-09-29T14:16:34Z","description":"Experimental rocket-powered aircraft","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_X-1","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_X-1?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_X-1?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bell_X-1"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_X-1","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Bell_X-1","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_X-1?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bell_X-1"}},"extract":"The Bell X-1 is a rocket engine–powered aircraft, designated originally as the XS-1, and was a joint National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics–U.S. Army Air Forces–U.S. Air Force supersonic research project built by Bell Aircraft.
