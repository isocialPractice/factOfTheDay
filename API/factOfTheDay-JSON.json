ALS is the most common of the motor neuron diseases. ALS often presents in its early stages with gradual muscle stiffness, twitches, weakness, and wasting. Motor neuron loss typically continues until the abilities to eat, speak, move, and breathe without mechanical support are lost. It is estimated that at least 50% of people with ALS experience significant changes in thinking and behavior, with 15% of individuals going on to develop frontotemporal dementia.

The largest represented leftist party in Congress, Free Peru, has subsequently aligned itself with conservative and Fujimorists parties within Congress due to their institutional power.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Congress of the Republic of Peru"},{"type":"standard","title":"José_María_Balcázar","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">José María Balcázar</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q108414587","titles":{"canonical":"José_María_Balcázar","normalized":"José María Balcázar","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">José María Balcázar</span>"},"pageid":82451696,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/El_presidente_Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Balc%C3%A1zar_Zelada_ingres%C3%B3_por_primera_vez_a_Palacio_de_Gobierno_0-9_screenshot_%28cropped%29.png/330px-El_presidente_Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Balc%C3%A1zar_Zelada_ingres%C3%B3_por_primera_vez_a_Palacio_de_Gobierno_0-9_screenshot_%28cropped%29.png","width":330,"height":413},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/El_presidente_Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Balc%C3%A1zar_Zelada_ingres%C3%B3_por_primera_vez_a_Palacio_de_Gobierno_0-9_screenshot_%28cropped%29.png","width":415,"height":519},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1339555509","tid":"7858b480-0ed8-11f1-9251-7aa25f2a3aad","timestamp":"2026-02-21T03:50:32Z","description":"President of Peru since 2026","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Balc%C3%A1zar","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Balc%C3%A1zar?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Balc%C3%A1zar?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Balc%C3%A1zar"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Balc%C3%A1zar","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Balc%C3%A1zar","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Balc%C3%A1zar?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Balc%C3%A1zar"}},"extract":"José María Balcázar Zelada is a Peruvian politician and lawyer who has been the 66th president of Peru since 2026.
