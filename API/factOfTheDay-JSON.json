The BBC has referred to the vote as \"one of the most dramatic nights in Westminster history\".</p>","normalizedtitle":"1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry"},{"type":"standard","title":"Winter_of_Discontent","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Winter of Discontent</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1247283","titles":{"canonical":"Winter_of_Discontent","normalized":"Winter of Discontent","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Winter of Discontent</span>"},"pageid":157946,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/James_Callaghan.JPG/320px-James_Callaghan.JPG","width":320,"height":411},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/James_Callaghan.JPG","width":1144,"height":1468},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1200741275","tid":"af8e4fe5-bf28-11ee-bfa0-f8443e347f35","timestamp":"2024-01-30T04:33:16Z","description":"Winter of 1978–79 in the United Kingdom","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_of_Discontent","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_of_Discontent?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_of_Discontent?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Winter_of_Discontent"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_of_Discontent","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Winter_of_Discontent","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_of_Discontent?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Winter_of_Discontent"}},"extract":"The Winter of Discontent was the period between November 1978 and February 1979 in the United Kingdom characterised by widespread strikes by private, and later public, sector trade unions demanding pay rises greater than the limits Prime Minister James Callaghan and his Labour Party government had been imposing, against Trades Union Congress (TUC) opposition, to control inflation.

The film contains excerpts of speeches given by Nazi leaders at the Congress, including Hitler, Rudolf Hess and Julius Streicher, interspersed with footage of massed Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) troops and public reaction. Its overriding theme is the return of Germany as a great power with Hitler as its leader. The film was produced after the Night of the Long Knives, and many formerly prominent SA members are absent.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Triumph of the Will"},{"type":"standard","title":"Leni_Riefenstahl","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Leni Riefenstahl</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q55415","titles":{"canonical":"Leni_Riefenstahl","normalized":"Leni Riefenstahl","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Leni Riefenstahl</span>"},"pageid":17562,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Riefenstahl_leni_postcard_olympia_crop_and_strip.jpg/320px-Riefenstahl_leni_postcard_olympia_crop_and_strip.jpg","width":320,"height":450},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Riefenstahl_leni_postcard_olympia_crop_and_strip.jpg","width":640,"height":900},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1215773393","tid":"9aefebdf-ebd6-11ee-a0fa-986116ae7a4c","timestamp":"2024-03-27T01:09:05Z","description":"German film director (1902–2003)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leni_Riefenstahl","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leni_Riefenstahl?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leni_Riefenstahl?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Leni_Riefenstahl"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leni_Riefenstahl","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Leni_Riefenstahl","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leni_Riefenstahl?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Leni_Riefenstahl"}},"extract":"Helene Bertha Amalie Riefenstahl was a German director, producer, screenwriter, editor, photographer and actress known for producing Nazi propaganda.","extract_html":"<p><b>Helene Bertha Amalie Riefenstahl</b> was a German director, producer, screenwriter, editor, photographer and actress known for producing Nazi propaganda.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Leni Riefenstahl"}],"year":1935},{"text":"After an on-board fire that may have been the first incident of airliner sabotage, the Imperial Airways biplane City of Liverpool broke apart in mid-air, killing fifteen people.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Imperial_Airways","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Imperial Airways</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q591797","titles":{"canonical":"Imperial_Airways","normalized":"Imperial Airways","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Imperial Airways</span>"},"pageid":15357,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/31/Speedbird_logo.png/320px-Speedbird_logo.png","width":320,"height":160},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/31/Speedbird_logo.png","width":400,"height":200},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1209506747","tid":"2516c70f-d14d-11ee-b042-e6d4f7233eac","timestamp":"2024-02-22T06:39:36Z","description":"British long-range airline (1924–1939)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Airways","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Airways?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Airways?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Imperial_Airways"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Airways","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Imperial_Airways","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Airways?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Imperial_Airways"}},"extract":"Imperial Airways was an early British commercial long-range airline, operating from 1924 to 1939 and principally serving the British Empire routes to South Africa, India, Australia and the Far East, including Malaya and Hong Kong.
