It occurred during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in the two standing-only central pens within the Leppings Lane stand allocated to Liverpool supporters. Shortly before kick-off, police match commander David Duckenfield ordered exit gate C to be opened in an attempt to ease crowding, which led to an influx of supporters entering the pens. This resulted in overcrowding of those pens and the fatal crush; with a total of 97 fatalities and 766 injuries, the disaster is the deadliest in British sporting history. Ninety-four people died on the day; one more died in hospital days later, Tony Bland died in 1993, and in 2021, a 97th person died. Both Bland and the 97th victim had suffered irreversible brain damage on the day.

It occurred during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in the two standing-only central pens within the Leppings Lane stand allocated to Liverpool supporters. Shortly before kick-off, police match commander David Duckenfield ordered exit gate C to be opened in an attempt to ease crowding, which led to an influx of supporters entering the pens.

Baroque music forms a major portion of the \"classical music\" canon, and is widely studied, performed, and listened to. The term \"baroque\" comes from the Portuguese word <i>barroco</i>, meaning \"misshapen pearl\". Key composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, Georg Philipp Telemann, \nDomenico Scarlatti, Claudio Monteverdi, Alessandro Stradella, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Arcangelo Corelli, François Couperin, Heinrich Schütz, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Baroque music"},{"type":"standard","title":"George_Frideric_Handel","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">George Frideric Handel</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q7302","titles":{"canonical":"George_Frideric_Handel","normalized":"George Frideric Handel","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">George Frideric Handel</span>"},"pageid":12775,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/George_Frideric_Handel_by_Balthasar_Denner.jpg/320px-George_Frideric_Handel_by_Balthasar_Denner.jpg","width":320,"height":387},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/George_Frideric_Handel_by_Balthasar_Denner.jpg","width":2400,"height":2901},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1281643777","tid":"32b0c6f2-0671-11f0-893f-f39f075b586f","timestamp":"2025-03-21T16:26:10Z","description":"German-British Baroque composer (1685–1759)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:George_Frideric_Handel"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/George_Frideric_Handel","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:George_Frideric_Handel"}},"extract":"George Frideric Handel was a German-British Baroque composer well-known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, concerti grossi, and organ concerti.","extract_html":"<p><b>George Frideric</b> <b>Handel</b> was a German-British Baroque composer well-known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, concerti grossi, and organ concerti.</p>","normalizedtitle":"George Frideric Handel"},{"type":"standard","title":"Xerxes_I","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Xerxes I</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q129165","titles":{"canonical":"Xerxes_I","normalized":"Xerxes I","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Xerxes I</span>"},"pageid":46289,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/National_Museum_of_Iran_Darafsh_%28785%29.JPG/330px-National_Museum_of_Iran_Darafsh_%28785%29.JPG","width":320,"height":483},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/National_Museum_of_Iran_Darafsh_%28785%29.JPG/3264px-National_Museum_of_Iran_Darafsh_%28785%29.JPG","width":3264,"height":4928},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1285041252","tid":"e594af53-16b8-11f0-b5cd-d4462bd9de31","timestamp":"2025-04-11T09:39:43Z","description":"King of Kings of the Achaemenid Empire from 486 to 465 BC","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Xerxes_I"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Xerxes_I","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Xerxes_I"}},"extract":"Xerxes I, commonly known as Xerxes the Great, was a Persian ruler who served as the fourth King of Kings of the Achaemenid Empire, reigning from 486 BC until his assassination in 465 BC.
