A person who commits espionage on a mission-specific contract is called an <i><b>espionage agent</b></i> or <i><b>spy</b></i>. A person who commits espionage as a fully employed officer of a government is called an intelligence officer. Any individual or spy ring, in the service of a government, company, criminal organization, or independent operation, can commit espionage. The practice is clandestine, as it is by definition unwelcome. In some circumstances, it may be a legal tool of law enforcement and in others, it may be illegal and punishable by law.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Espionage"}],"year":1987},{"text":"Jerry Rawlings came to power in Ghana as chairman of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Jerry_Rawlings","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Jerry Rawlings</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q51002","titles":{"canonical":"Jerry_Rawlings","normalized":"Jerry Rawlings","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Jerry Rawlings</span>"},"pageid":418094,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Fmr_Prez._Rawlings_%28cropped%29.jpg/330px-Fmr_Prez._Rawlings_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":320,"height":452},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Fmr_Prez._Rawlings_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":1044,"height":1476},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1291839866","tid":"b1a6b15c-3804-11f0-b85a-a38aecb6d6e3","timestamp":"2025-05-23T18:35:26Z","description":"Leader of Ghana in 1979 and 1981–2001","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Rawlings","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Rawlings?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Rawlings?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jerry_Rawlings"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Rawlings","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Jerry_Rawlings","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Rawlings?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jerry_Rawlings"}},"extract":"Jerry John Rawlings was a Ghanaian military officer, aviator, and politician who led the country briefly in 1979 and then from 1981 to 2001.
