These storms are continuously rotating around a low pressure center, which causes stormy weather across a large area, which is not limited to just the eye of the storm. They are organized systems of clouds and thunderstorms that originate over tropical or subtropical waters and have closed low-level circulation, and should not be confused with tornadoes, which are another type of cyclone. In the North Atlantic and the Eastern Pacific, the term hurricane is used, whereas <i>typhoon</i> is used in the Western Pacific near Asia. The more general term <i>cyclone</i> is used in the rest of the ocean basins, namely the South Pacific and Indian Ocean.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Atlantic hurricane"},{"type":"standard","title":"Gulf_of_St._Lawrence","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Gulf of St. Lawrence</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q169523","titles":{"canonical":"Gulf_of_St._Lawrence","normalized":"Gulf of St. Lawrence","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Gulf of St. Lawrence</span>"},"pageid":70583,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Baie_Trinite_023.jpg/330px-Baie_Trinite_023.jpg","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Baie_Trinite_023.jpg","width":1600,"height":1200},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1296316822","tid":"8321d40e-4cdd-11f0-beb8-93994aacf4cf","timestamp":"2025-06-19T07:17:52Z","description":"Outlet of the Great Lakes into the Atlantic","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":48.6,"lon":-61.4},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_St._Lawrence","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_St._Lawrence?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_St._Lawrence?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gulf_of_St._Lawrence"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_St._Lawrence","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Gulf_of_St._Lawrence","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_St._Lawrence?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gulf_of_St._Lawrence"}},"extract":"The Gulf of St. Lawrence is a gulf that fringes the shores of the provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, in Canada, plus the islands Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, possessions of France, in North America.","extract_html":"<p>The <b>Gulf of St. Lawrence</b> is a gulf that fringes the shores of the provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, in Canada, plus the islands Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, possessions of France, in North America.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Gulf of St. Lawrence"},{"type":"standard","title":"1959_Escuminac_disaster","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">1959 Escuminac disaster</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3045037","titles":{"canonical":"1959_Escuminac_disaster","normalized":"1959 Escuminac disaster","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">1959 Escuminac disaster</span>"},"pageid":941884,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/1959_Escuminac_hurricane_track.png/330px-1959_Escuminac_hurricane_track.png","width":320,"height":204},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/1959_Escuminac_hurricane_track.png","width":3000,"height":1912},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1296450014","tid":"abf9a3b3-4d7d-11f0-9cc7-c9ca2bfb056c","timestamp":"2025-06-20T02:24:20Z","description":"Category 1 Atlantic hurricane in 1959","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_Escuminac_disaster","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_Escuminac_disaster?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_Escuminac_disaster?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:1959_Escuminac_disaster"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_Escuminac_disaster","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/1959_Escuminac_disaster","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_Escuminac_disaster?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:1959_Escuminac_disaster"}},"extract":"The 1959 Escuminac disaster, also known as the Escuminac hurricane, was considered the worst fishing-related disaster in New Brunswick in 100 years.

On the return leg they bombed the Italian naval base at La Spezia.\nSchweinfurt–Regensburg mission, 17 August 1943: The 4th Bombardment Wing of the Eighth Air Force using B-17s equipped with \"Tokyo (fuel) tanks\" for longer range, attacked the Messerschmitt Bf 109 plants in Regensburg and then flew on to bases in Bône, Berteaux and Telergma. Most of the aircraft that had been damaged were stranded due to the poor repair facilities in Algeria and some of them were never returned to service. Eight days later, on 24 August, on the way back to their bases in Great Britain, the surviving B-17s bombed targets in Bordeaux.\nOperation Frantic, from June to September 1944: This was a series of air raids conducted by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bombers based in Britain or the Mediterranean which then landed at bases built by the Americans in Ukraine in the Soviet Union. As a military operation it made possible eighteen strong attacks on important strategic targets in Germany which would otherwise have been immune.\nThe Warsaw Airlift, August to September 1944: During the Warsaw Uprising the Frantic airbases were used for an airdrop to the Poles fighting in the city.

On 18 September 107 of 110 B-17s dropped 1,248 containers of supplies to Polish forces in Warsaw and flew on to the USSR losing one B-17 with seven more damaged. The next day 100 B-17s and 61 P-51s left the USSR and bombed the marshalling yard at Szolnok in Hungary as they returned to bases in Italy.\nOperation Paravane, September 1944: A variation on the concept.
