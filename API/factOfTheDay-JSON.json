Set in Denmark, the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his attempts to exact revenge against his uncle, Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet's father in order to seize his throne and marry Hamlet's mother. <i>Hamlet</i> is considered among the \"most powerful and influential tragedies in the English language\", with a story capable of \"seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others\". It is widely considered one of the greatest plays of all time. Three different early versions of the play are extant: the First Quarto ; the Second Quarto ; and the First Folio. Each version includes lines and passages missing from the others.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Hamlet"}],"year":1913},{"text":"Qing China signed the Treaty of Livadia with the Russian Empire, but the terms were so unfavorable that the Chinese government refused to ratify the treaty.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Qing_dynasty","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Qing dynasty</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q8733","titles":{"canonical":"Qing_dynasty","normalized":"Qing dynasty","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Qing dynasty</span>"},"pageid":25310,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Flag_of_China_%281889%E2%80%931912%29.svg/320px-Flag_of_China_%281889%E2%80%931912%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Flag_of_China_%281889%E2%80%931912%29.svg/512px-Flag_of_China_%281889%E2%80%931912%29.svg.png","width":512,"height":341},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1244824100","tid":"55814656-6ea4-11ef-ac0e-14f591ab17ea","timestamp":"2024-09-09T12:09:16Z","description":"Manchu-led dynasty of China (1644–1912)","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":39.92,"lon":116.39},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Qing_dynasty"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Qing_dynasty","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Qing_dynasty"}},"extract":"The Qing dynasty, officially the Great Qing, was a Manchu-led imperial dynasty of China and the last imperial dynasty in Chinese history.
