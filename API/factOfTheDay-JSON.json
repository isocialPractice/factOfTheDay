The U.S. Armed Forces were formally segregated until 1948, as black units were separated from white units but were still typically led by white officers.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Racial segregation in the United States"}],"year":1964},{"text":"A German SS unit arrived in Vilnius, Lithuania, and began the systematic execution of up to 100,000 people over the next three years.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Schutzstaffel","displaytitle":"<i>Schutzstaffel</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q44687","titles":{"canonical":"Schutzstaffel","normalized":"Schutzstaffel","display":"<i>Schutzstaffel</i>"},"pageid":27040,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-H04436%2C_Klagenfurt%2C_Adolf_Hitler%2C_Ehrenkompanie.jpg/320px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-H04436%2C_Klagenfurt%2C_Adolf_Hitler%2C_Ehrenkompanie.jpg","width":320,"height":238},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-H04436%2C_Klagenfurt%2C_Adolf_Hitler%2C_Ehrenkompanie.jpg","width":796,"height":593},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1228180396","tid":"a15712e0-26a7-11ef-a5a4-7dcd59c14530","timestamp":"2024-06-09T21:31:28Z","description":"Nazi paramilitary organisation (1925–1945)","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":52.50694444,"lon":13.38277778},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Schutzstaffel"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Schutzstaffel","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Schutzstaffel"}},"extract":"The Schutzstaffel was a major paramilitary organisation under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany, and later throughout German-occupied Europe during World War II.","extract_html":"<p>The <i><b>Schutzstaffel</b></i> was a major paramilitary organisation under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany, and later throughout German-occupied Europe during World War II.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Schutzstaffel"},{"type":"standard","title":"Vilnius","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Vilnius</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q216","titles":{"canonical":"Vilnius","normalized":"Vilnius","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Vilnius</span>"},"pageid":32597,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Vilnius_old_town_by_Augustas_Didzgalvis.jpg/320px-Vilnius_old_town_by_Augustas_Didzgalvis.jpg","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Vilnius_old_town_by_Augustas_Didzgalvis.jpg","width":1800,"height":1200},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1231297096","tid":"1e9daf88-349b-11ef-af55-75cf87007e81","timestamp":"2024-06-27T15:37:11Z","description":"Capital and largest city of Lithuania","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":54.68722222,"lon":25.28},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vilnius"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Vilnius","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vilnius"}},"extract":"Vilnius is the capital of and largest city in Lithuania, and the second-most populous city in the Baltic states.
