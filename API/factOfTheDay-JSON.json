He is best known for his work on founding the field of human–computer interaction, particularly while at his Augmentation Research Center Lab in SRI International, which resulted in creation of the computer mouse, and the development of hypertext, networked computers, and precursors to graphical user interfaces. These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968. Engelbart's law, the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Douglas Engelbart"},{"type":"standard","title":"The_Mother_of_All_Demos","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">The Mother of All Demos</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3521932","titles":{"canonical":"The_Mother_of_All_Demos","normalized":"The Mother of All Demos","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">The Mother of All Demos</span>"},"pageid":921487,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/SRI_Douglas_Engelbart_1968.jpg/320px-SRI_Douglas_Engelbart_1968.jpg","width":320,"height":439},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/SRI_Douglas_Engelbart_1968.jpg","width":600,"height":823},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1262001284","tid":"5aee4bd5-b5d5-11ef-9619-6763ec028f7f","timestamp":"2024-12-09T02:29:03Z","description":"1968 computer demonstration by Douglas Engelbart","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Mother_of_All_Demos"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/The_Mother_of_All_Demos","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Mother_of_All_Demos"}},"extract":"\"The Mother of All Demos\" was a landmark computer demonstration, named retroactively, of developments by Stanford Research Institute's Augmentation Research Center, given at the Association for Computing Machinery / Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (ACM/IEEE)—Computer Society's Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco, by Douglas Engelbart, on December 9, 1968.","extract_html":"<p>\"<b>The Mother of All Demos</b>\" was a landmark computer demonstration, named retroactively, of developments by Stanford Research Institute's Augmentation Research Center, given at the Association for Computing Machinery / Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (ACM/IEEE)—Computer Society's Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco, by Douglas Engelbart, on December 9, 1968.</p>","normalizedtitle":"The Mother of All Demos"},{"type":"standard","title":"Computer_mouse","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Computer mouse</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q7987","titles":{"canonical":"Computer_mouse","normalized":"Computer mouse","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Computer mouse</span>"},"pageid":7056,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/3-Tasten-Maus_Microsoft.jpg/320px-3-Tasten-Maus_Microsoft.jpg","width":320,"height":280},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/3-Tasten-Maus_Microsoft.jpg","width":800,"height":701},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1261426124","tid":"b23fc1c8-b370-11ef-ab6c-595eaca373af","timestamp":"2024-12-06T01:23:28Z","description":"Pointing device used to control a computer","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Computer_mouse"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Computer_mouse","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Computer_mouse"}},"extract":"A computer mouse is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface.
