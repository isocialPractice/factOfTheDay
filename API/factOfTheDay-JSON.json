One of its great advantages is that, by sailing in international waters, it does not interfere with any territorial sovereignty and thus obviates the need for overflight authorizations from third-party countries, reduces the times and transit distances of aircraft and therefore significantly increases the time of availability on the combat zone.","extract_html":"<p>An <b>aircraft carrier</b> is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft.

By its diplomatic and tactical power, its mobility, its autonomy and the variety of its means, the aircraft carrier is often the centerpiece of modern combat fleets. Tactically or even strategically, it replaced the battleship in the role of flagship of a fleet. One of its great advantages is that, by sailing in international waters, it does not interfere with any territorial sovereignty and thus obviates the need for overflight authorizations from third-party countries, reduces the times and transit distances of aircraft and therefore significantly increases the time of availability on the combat zone.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Aircraft carrier"}],"year":1922},{"text":"A public speech by the Polish pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski in Poznań sparked the Greater Poland uprising against Germany.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ignacy Jan Paderewski</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q191957","titles":{"canonical":"Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski","normalized":"Ignacy Jan Paderewski","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ignacy Jan Paderewski</span>"},"pageid":711408,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski.PNG/320px-Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski.PNG","width":320,"height":402},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski.PNG","width":630,"height":792},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1191611882","tid":"1d6b51f0-a275-11ee-95d6-1b1a4fbe387b","timestamp":"2023-12-24T15:57:13Z","description":"Polish pianist, composer and politician (1860–1941)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ignacy_Jan_Paderewski"}},"extract":"Ignacy Jan Paderewski was a Polish pianist, composer and statesman who was a spokesman for Polish independence.
