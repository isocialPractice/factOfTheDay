From a Catholic viewpoint, the primacy of the bishop of Rome is largely derived from his role as the apostolic successor to Saint Peter, to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus, who gave Peter the Keys of Heaven and the powers of \"binding and loosing\", naming him as the \"rock\" upon which the Church would be built. The most recent pope was Francis, who died on 21 April 2025. The papacy is currently vacant until a new pope is chosen in the upcoming 2025 papal conclave.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Pope"},{"views":204142,"rank":11,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-04-18Z","views":3910},{"date":"2025-04-19Z","views":4039},{"date":"2025-04-20Z","views":5214},{"date":"2025-04-21Z","views":19359},{"date":"2025-04-22Z","views":204142}],"type":"standard","title":"Earth_Day","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Earth Day</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q124473","titles":{"canonical":"Earth_Day","normalized":"Earth Day","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Earth Day</span>"},"pageid":158548,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Earth_Day_Flag.png/330px-Earth_Day_Flag.png","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Earth_Day_Flag.png","width":6000,"height":4000},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1286943665","tid":"8d726ea0-1fd7-11f0-a19c-b4ff8f9eaf1b","timestamp":"2025-04-23T00:11:50Z","description":"Annual international event on April 22","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Earth_Day"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Earth_Day","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Earth_Day"}},"extract":"Earth Day is an annual event on April 22 to demonstrate support for environmental protection.
