The frequency of Tests has steadily increased partly because of the increase in the number of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.</p>","normalizedtitle":"List of Test cricket records"},{"type":"standard","title":"Test_cricket","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Test cricket</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1132113","titles":{"canonical":"Test_cricket","normalized":"Test cricket","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Test cricket</span>"},"pageid":30863,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/England_vs_South_Africa.jpg/320px-England_vs_South_Africa.jpg","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/England_vs_South_Africa.jpg","width":3008,"height":2000},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1214266050","tid":"d50e0a08-e4ad-11ee-bdc3-3a44ca4bfbe8","timestamp":"2024-03-17T22:29:35Z","description":"Longest form of cricket","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Test_cricket"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Test_cricket","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Test_cricket"}},"extract":"Test cricket is a form of first-class cricket played at the international level between teams representing full member countries of the International Cricket Council (ICC).
