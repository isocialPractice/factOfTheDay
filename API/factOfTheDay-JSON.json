It was a French victory; however, it was the last battle in Napoleon's perfect military career as two months later he would be defeated at the Second Battle of Bassano, ending his victorious streak. The Austrians abandoned their artillery and baggage, losing supplies, cannons, and battle standards to the French. The victory led to Wurmser being trapped in Mantua, but Napoleon would find his army now badly overstretched, due to holding both Trento and Bassano, meaning he could not support either of those locations without being drawn too far away from the other, something that would nearly allow the Austrians to win during the third attempt to raise the siege of Mantua in November.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Battle of Bassano"},{"type":"standard","title":"Bassano_del_Grappa","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Bassano del Grappa</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q47094","titles":{"canonical":"Bassano_del_Grappa","normalized":"Bassano del Grappa","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Bassano del Grappa</span>"},"pageid":826334,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Bassano_del_Grappa_Vista_Aerea.jpg/320px-Bassano_del_Grappa_Vista_Aerea.jpg","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Bassano_del_Grappa_Vista_Aerea.jpg","width":3968,"height":2976},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1228135033","tid":"262f2f29-2682-11ef-8f12-b0294f2a33c8","timestamp":"2024-06-09T17:03:10Z","description":"Comune in Veneto, Italy","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":45.76666667,"lon":11.73416667},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassano_del_Grappa","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassano_del_Grappa?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassano_del_Grappa?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bassano_del_Grappa"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassano_del_Grappa","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Bassano_del_Grappa","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassano_del_Grappa?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bassano_del_Grappa"}},"extract":"Bassano del Grappa is a city and comune, in the Vicenza province, in the region of Veneto, in northern Italy.

These populations exhibit significant diversity; some Indigenous peoples were historically hunter-gatherers, while others practiced agriculture and aquaculture. Various Indigenous societies developed complex social structures, including pre-contact monumental architecture, organized cities, city-states, chiefdoms, states, kingdoms, republics, confederacies, and empires. These societies possessed varying levels of knowledge in fields such as engineering, architecture, mathematics, astronomy, writing, physics, medicine, agriculture, irrigation, geology, mining, metallurgy, sculpture, and goldsmithing.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas"}],"year":1755},{"text":"Ottoman–Habsburg wars: Although Ottoman forces led by Suleiman the Magnificent captured the fortress of Szigetvár in Hungary, they were forced to end their campaign to take Vienna.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Ottoman–Habsburg_wars","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ottoman–Habsburg wars</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q786171","titles":{"canonical":"Ottoman–Habsburg_wars","normalized":"Ottoman–Habsburg wars","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ottoman–Habsburg wars</span>"},"pageid":11823525,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/MixCollage-15-Jan-2024-09-37-PM-7066.jpg/320px-MixCollage-15-Jan-2024-09-37-PM-7066.jpg","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/MixCollage-15-Jan-2024-09-37-PM-7066.jpg","width":3000,"height":3000},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1243646983","tid":"e14d2d4c-6950-11ef-bce4-c4b322dcf1e1","timestamp":"2024-09-02T17:29:17Z","description":"1526–1791 series of wars in Europe","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ottoman%E2%80%93Habsburg_wars"}},"extract":"The Ottoman–Habsburg wars were fought from the 16th to the 18th centuries between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg monarchy, which was at times supported by the Kingdom of Hungary, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and Habsburg Spain.
