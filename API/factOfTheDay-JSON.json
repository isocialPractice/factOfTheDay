The screenplay was written by Kubrick and science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, and was inspired by Clarke's 1951 short story \"The Sentinel\" and other short stories by Clarke. Clarke also published a novelisation of the film, in part written concurrently with the screenplay, after the film's release. The film stars Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, and Douglas Rain and follows a voyage by astronauts, scientists, and the sentient supercomputer HAL to Jupiter to investigate an alien monolith.</p>","normalizedtitle":"2001: A Space Odyssey"},{"type":"standard","title":"Science_fiction_film","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Science fiction film</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q471839","titles":{"canonical":"Science_fiction_film","normalized":"Science fiction film","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Science fiction film</span>"},"pageid":179757,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Sci-fi_film_icon.svg/320px-Sci-fi_film_icon.svg.png","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Sci-fi_film_icon.svg/45px-Sci-fi_film_icon.svg.png","width":45,"height":45},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1212144925","tid":"1810d986-dba2-11ee-9790-cf38c5dd2fac","timestamp":"2024-03-06T10:12:53Z","description":"Film genre","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Science_fiction_film"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Science_fiction_film","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Science_fiction_film"}},"extract":"Science fiction is a film genre that uses speculative, fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, spacecraft, robots, cyborgs, mutants, interstellar travel, time travel, or other technologies.
