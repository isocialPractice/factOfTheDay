After 1947, the Cup became the <i>de jure</i> NHL championship prize.</p>","normalizedtitle":"List of Stanley Cup champions"},{"views":59911,"rank":41,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-06-18Z","views":60602},{"date":"2024-06-19Z","views":50457},{"date":"2024-06-20Z","views":37574},{"date":"2024-06-21Z","views":41379},{"date":"2024-06-22Z","views":59911}],"type":"standard","title":"Maharaja_(2024_film)","displaytitle":"<i>Maharaja</i> (2024 film)","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q126595889","titles":{"canonical":"Maharaja_(2024_film)","normalized":"Maharaja (2024 film)","display":"<i>Maharaja</i> (2024 film)"},"pageid":77038622,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/82/Maharaja_2024_film_poster.jpg","width":275,"height":363},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/82/Maharaja_2024_film_poster.jpg","width":275,"height":363},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1230504669","tid":"53aebbdc-310f-11ef-b138-2614679bd829","timestamp":"2024-06-23T03:18:57Z","description":"2024 film by Nithilan Saminathan","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja_(2024_film)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja_(2024_film)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja_(2024_film)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Maharaja_(2024_film)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja_(2024_film)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Maharaja_(2024_film)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja_(2024_film)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Maharaja_(2024_film)"}},"extract":"Maharaja is a 2024 Indian Tamil-language crime drama film directed by Nithilan Swaminathan, who co-wrote the dialogues with Raam Murali.

The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Basketball"},{"type":"standard","title":"Boston_Celtics","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Boston Celtics</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q131371","titles":{"canonical":"Boston_Celtics","normalized":"Boston Celtics","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Boston Celtics</span>"},"pageid":43376,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/Boston_Celtics.svg/320px-Boston_Celtics.svg.png","width":320,"height":356},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/Boston_Celtics.svg/243px-Boston_Celtics.svg.png","width":243,"height":270},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1230496077","tid":"f44bab12-3104-11ef-9d36-48a1afd8ada0","timestamp":"2024-06-23T02:04:42Z","description":"American professional basketball team","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boston_Celtics"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Boston_Celtics","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boston_Celtics"}},"extract":"The Boston Celtics are an American professional basketball team based in Boston.

A suspected chemical attack on Douma on 9 April 2018 that killed at least 49 civilians has been blamed on the Syrian Government.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Syria chemical weapons program"},{"type":"standard","title":"Destruction_of_Syria's_chemical_weapons","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Destruction of Syria&#039;s chemical weapons</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q14943147","titles":{"canonical":"Destruction_of_Syria's_chemical_weapons","normalized":"Destruction of Syria's chemical weapons","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Destruction of Syria&#039;s chemical weapons</span>"},"pageid":40529953,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Syrian_reconciliation_flag.png/320px-Syrian_reconciliation_flag.png","width":320,"height":192},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Syrian_reconciliation_flag.png","width":643,"height":386},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1223072450","tid":"90a93745-0e30-11ef-8421-b44f33693abb","timestamp":"2024-05-09T18:18:42Z","description":"Part of the Syrian peace process","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_Syria's_chemical_weapons","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_Syria's_chemical_weapons?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_Syria's_chemical_weapons?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Destruction_of_Syria's_chemical_weapons"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_Syria's_chemical_weapons","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Destruction_of_Syria's_chemical_weapons","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_Syria's_chemical_weapons?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Destruction_of_Syria's_chemical_weapons"}},"extract":"The destruction of Syria's chemical weapons began on 14 September 2013 after Syria entered into several international agreements which called for the elimination of Syria's chemical weapon stockpiles and set a destruction deadline of 30 June 2014.
