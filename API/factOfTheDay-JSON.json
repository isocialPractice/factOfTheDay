While in Pakistan, he was caught and arrested by the FBI with help from Pakistani police forces. After being returned to the U.S., he was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. He was executed by lethal injection in 2002.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Mir Aimal Kansi"},{"type":"standard","title":"CIA_headquarters_shooting","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">CIA headquarters shooting</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1567023","titles":{"canonical":"CIA_headquarters_shooting","normalized":"CIA headquarters shooting","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">CIA headquarters shooting</span>"},"pageid":13231355,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Nhb-exterior-020.jpg/320px-Nhb-exterior-020.jpg","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Nhb-exterior-020.jpg","width":2496,"height":1664},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1198802346","tid":"c81fa1b0-bb2e-11ee-8cf8-a1734a41c420","timestamp":"2024-01-25T03:06:47Z","description":"1993 killing of two CIA employees in Langley, Virginia, US","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_headquarters_shooting","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_headquarters_shooting?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_headquarters_shooting?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:CIA_headquarters_shooting"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_headquarters_shooting","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/CIA_headquarters_shooting","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_headquarters_shooting?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:CIA_headquarters_shooting"}},"extract":"On January 25, 1993, outside of CIA Headquarters campus in Langley, Virginia, Pakistani national Mir Aimal Kansi shot and killed two CIA employees in their cars as they were waiting at a stoplight and wounded three others.","extract_html":"<p>On January 25, 1993, outside of CIA Headquarters campus in Langley, Virginia, Pakistani national Mir Aimal Kansi shot and killed two CIA employees in their cars as they were waiting at a stoplight and wounded three others.</p>","normalizedtitle":"CIA headquarters shooting"},{"type":"standard","title":"Central_Intelligence_Agency","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Central Intelligence Agency</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q37230","titles":{"canonical":"Central_Intelligence_Agency","normalized":"Central Intelligence Agency","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Central Intelligence Agency</span>"},"pageid":5183633,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Seal_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency.svg/320px-Seal_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency.svg.png","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Seal_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency.svg/510px-Seal_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency.svg.png","width":510,"height":510},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1198672583","tid":"06a0b6d0-baef-11ee-862c-1d724cf61651","timestamp":"2024-01-24T19:27:54Z","description":"National intelligence agency of the United States","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":38.95194444,"lon":-77.14611111},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Central_Intelligence_Agency"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Central_Intelligence_Agency","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Central_Intelligence_Agency"}},"extract":"The Central Intelligence Agency, known informally as the Agency and historically as the Company, is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States, officially tasked with gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT) and conducting covert action through its Directorate of Operations.
