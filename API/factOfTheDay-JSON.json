Calais overlooks the Strait of Dover, the narrowest point in the English Channel, which is only 34 km (21 mi) wide here, and is the closest French town to England. The White Cliffs of Dover can easily be seen on a clear day from Calais. Calais is a major port for ferries between France and England, and since 1994, the Channel Tunnel has linked nearby Coquelles to Folkestone by rail.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Calais"},{"type":"standard","title":"Siege_of_Calais_(1346–1347)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Siege of Calais (1346–1347)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q676340","titles":{"canonical":"Siege_of_Calais_(1346–1347)","normalized":"Siege of Calais (1346–1347)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Siege of Calais (1346–1347)</span>"},"pageid":1396819,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Belagerung_von_Calais_1346-1347.JPG/320px-Belagerung_von_Calais_1346-1347.JPG","width":320,"height":261},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Belagerung_von_Calais_1346-1347.JPG","width":3149,"height":2571},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1237564608","tid":"9da35f81-4e6a-11ef-9fd7-39d6d27cd7fc","timestamp":"2024-07-30T11:55:29Z","description":"Siege by King Edward III during the Hundred Years' War","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":50.958,"lon":1.853},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Calais_(1346%E2%80%931347)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Calais_(1346%E2%80%931347)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Calais_(1346%E2%80%931347)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Siege_of_Calais_(1346%E2%80%931347)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Calais_(1346%E2%80%931347)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Siege_of_Calais_(1346%E2%80%931347)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Calais_(1346%E2%80%931347)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Siege_of_Calais_(1346%E2%80%931347)"}},"extract":"The siege of Calais occurred at the conclusion of the Crécy campaign, when an English army under the command of King Edward III of England successfully besieged the French town of Calais during the Edwardian phase of the Hundred Years' War.","extract_html":"<p>The <b>siege of Calais</b> occurred at the conclusion of the Crécy campaign, when an English army under the command of King Edward III of England successfully besieged the French town of Calais during the Edwardian phase of the Hundred Years' War.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Siege of Calais (1346–1347)"},{"type":"standard","title":"Crécy_campaign","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Crécy campaign</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2963047","titles":{"canonical":"Crécy_campaign","normalized":"Crécy campaign","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Crécy campaign</span>"},"pageid":59008001,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Prise_caen_1346.jpg/320px-Prise_caen_1346.jpg","width":320,"height":308},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Prise_caen_1346.jpg","width":1977,"height":1905},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1234779375","tid":"7902ac82-4320-11ef-aa22-2e39d72f9031","timestamp":"2024-07-16T03:07:02Z","description":"1346–1347 military campaign during the Hundred Years' War","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A9cy_campaign","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A9cy_campaign?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A9cy_campaign?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cr%C3%A9cy_campaign"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A9cy_campaign","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Cr%C3%A9cy_campaign","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A9cy_campaign?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cr%C3%A9cy_campaign"}},"extract":"The Crécy campaign was a series of large-scale raids (chevauchées) conducted by the Kingdom of England throughout northern France in 1346 that devastated the French countryside on a wide front, culminating in the Battle of Crécy.
