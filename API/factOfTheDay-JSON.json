The term \"McCarthyism\", coined in 1950 in reference to McCarthy's practices, was soon applied to similar anti-communist activities. Today the term is used more broadly to mean demagogic, reckless, and unsubstantiated accusations, as well as public attacks on the character or patriotism of political opponents.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Joseph McCarthy"},{"type":"standard","title":"United_States_Department_of_State","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">United States Department of State</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q789915","titles":{"canonical":"United_States_Department_of_State","normalized":"United States Department of State","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">United States Department of State</span>"},"pageid":31975,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/U.S._Department_of_State_official_seal.svg/320px-U.S._Department_of_State_official_seal.svg.png","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/U.S._Department_of_State_official_seal.svg/512px-U.S._Department_of_State_official_seal.svg.png","width":512,"height":512},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1274280991","tid":"a4e8ae4f-e48d-11ef-9a75-bf5569b75c4c","timestamp":"2025-02-06T13:24:08Z","description":"Executive department of the U.S. federal government","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":38.89416667,"lon":-77.04833333},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:United_States_Department_of_State"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/United_States_Department_of_State","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:United_States_Department_of_State"}},"extract":"The United States Department of State (DOS), or simply the State Department, is an executive department of the U.S. federal government responsible for the country's foreign policy and relations.
