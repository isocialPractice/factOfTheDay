The right to participate in a conclave is limited to cardinals who have not reached the age of 80 years by the day the vacancy occurs. In addition, cardinals collectively participate in papal consistories, in which matters of importance to the Church are considered and new cardinals may be created. Cardinals of working age are also appointed to roles overseeing dicasteries of the Roman Curia, the central administration of the Catholic Church.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Cardinal (Catholic Church)"},{"type":"standard","title":"May_1605_papal_conclave","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">May 1605 papal conclave</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q4702067","titles":{"canonical":"May_1605_papal_conclave","normalized":"May 1605 papal conclave","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">May 1605 papal conclave</span>"},"pageid":32625540,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Pope_Paul_V.jpg/320px-Pope_Paul_V.jpg","width":320,"height":541},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Pope_Paul_V.jpg","width":644,"height":1088},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1195906336","tid":"1ebf5b53-b3df-11ee-9521-cf494d4f192c","timestamp":"2024-01-15T19:48:57Z","description":"Election of Pope Paul V","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1605_papal_conclave","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1605_papal_conclave?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1605_papal_conclave?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:May_1605_papal_conclave"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1605_papal_conclave","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/May_1605_papal_conclave","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1605_papal_conclave?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:May_1605_papal_conclave"}},"extract":"In the papal conclave held from 8 to 16 May 1605 Cardinal Camillo Borghes was elected to succeed Leo XI as pope.
