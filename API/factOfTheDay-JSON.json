Bound together in a political union, each state holds governmental jurisdiction over a separate and defined geographic territory where it shares its sovereignty with the federal government. Due to this shared sovereignty, Americans are citizens both of the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons restricted by certain types of court orders.</p>","normalizedtitle":"U.S. state"}],"year":1876},{"text":"Three days of rioting erupted after a parade in Philadelphia, celebrating the end of slavery in the West Indies, was attacked by a mob.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Lombard_Street_riot","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Lombard Street riot</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q6669368","titles":{"canonical":"Lombard_Street_riot","normalized":"Lombard Street riot","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Lombard Street riot</span>"},"pageid":17198124,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/1846_Street_Map_or_Plan_of_Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_-_Geographicus_-_Phili-m-1846.jpg/330px-1846_Street_Map_or_Plan_of_Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_-_Geographicus_-_Phili-m-1846.jpg","width":320,"height":398},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/1846_Street_Map_or_Plan_of_Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_-_Geographicus_-_Phili-m-1846.jpg","width":2415,"height":3000},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1289634029","tid":"6cb949ba-2d19-11f0-8aff-e0708f4dd56c","timestamp":"2025-05-09T21:06:07Z","description":"Racial riot in Philadelphia in 1842","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":39.943,"lon":-75.152},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_riot","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_riot?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_riot?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lombard_Street_riot"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_riot","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Lombard_Street_riot","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_riot?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lombard_Street_riot"}},"extract":"The Lombard Street riot was a three-day race riot in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1842.
