Mars retains some water, in the ground as well as thinly in the atmosphere, forming cirrus clouds, fog, frost, larger polar regions of permafrost and ice caps, but no bodies of liquid surface water. Its surface gravity is roughly a third of Earth's or double that of the Moon. Its diameter, 6,779 km (4,212 mi), is about half the Earth's, or twice the Moon's, and its surface area is the size of all the dry land of Earth.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Mars"},{"type":"standard","title":"Eagle_(crater)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Eagle (crater)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2083022","titles":{"canonical":"Eagle_(crater)","normalized":"Eagle (crater)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Eagle (crater)</span>"},"pageid":2247195,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Eagle_crater_panorama.jpg/330px-Eagle_crater_panorama.jpg","width":320,"height":106},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Eagle_crater_panorama.jpg","width":1024,"height":339},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1311005457","tid":"27838e6c-9019-11f0-9938-7b48f833804c","timestamp":"2025-09-12T20:43:36Z","description":"Crater on Mars","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_(crater)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_(crater)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_(crater)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Eagle_(crater)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_(crater)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Eagle_(crater)","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_(crater)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Eagle_(crater)"}},"extract":"Eagle is a 22-metre long impact crater located on the Meridiani Planum extraterrestrial plain, situated within the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle (MC-19) portion of the planet Mars.
