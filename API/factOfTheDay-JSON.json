Mozart is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music, with his music admired for its \"melodic beauty, its formal elegance and its richness of harmony and texture\".</p>","normalizedtitle":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"}],"year":1771},{"text":"A series of executions of the commissioners who signed the death warrant of King Charles I of England concluded; six were hanged, drawn and quartered for treason.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"List_of_regicides_of_Charles_I","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">List of regicides of Charles I</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1439921","titles":{"canonical":"List_of_regicides_of_Charles_I","normalized":"List of regicides of Charles I","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">List of regicides of Charles I</span>"},"pageid":1514178,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Death_warrant_of_Charles_I.jpg/330px-Death_warrant_of_Charles_I.jpg","width":320,"height":171},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Death_warrant_of_Charles_I.jpg","width":2048,"height":1093},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1317235353","tid":"d67a248f-ab05-11f0-8e42-8f5b406e8538","timestamp":"2025-10-17T03:03:21Z","description":"","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regicides_of_Charles_I","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regicides_of_Charles_I?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regicides_of_Charles_I?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_regicides_of_Charles_I"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regicides_of_Charles_I","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/List_of_regicides_of_Charles_I","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regicides_of_Charles_I?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_regicides_of_Charles_I"}},"extract":"The Regicides of Charles I were the men responsible for the execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649.

An invading Scottish army of 12,000 led by King David II was defeated with heavy loss by an English army of approximately 6,000–7,000 men led by Ralph Neville, Lord Neville. The battle was named after an Anglo-Saxon stone cross that stood on the hill where the Scots made their stand. After the victory, Neville paid to have a new cross erected to commemorate the day.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Battle of Neville's Cross"}],"year":1346}],"dyk":[{"html":"... that the giant centipede <i id=\"mwDA\"><b id=\"mwDQ\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormocephalus_rubriceps\" title=\"Cormocephalus rubriceps\" id=\"mwDg\">Cormocephalus rubriceps</a></b></i> <i id=\"mwDw\"></i> can grow up to 20 centimetres (8 inches) in length?","text":"... that the giant centipede Cormocephalus rubriceps can grow up to 20 centimetres (8 inches) in length?"},{"html":"... that <b id=\"mwEQ\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_Cristiano_Ronaldo_videos_in_Russian_espionage_plot\" title=\"Use of Cristiano Ronaldo videos in Russian espionage plot\" id=\"mwEg\">a Russian spy couple used comments</a></b> on Cristiano Ronaldo YouTube videos to send coded messages to Moscow?","text":"... that a Russian spy couple used comments on Cristiano Ronaldo YouTube videos to send coded messages to Moscow?"},{"html":"... that racing driver <b id=\"mwFA\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Cunningham\" title=\"Neil Cunningham\" id=\"mwFQ\">Neil Cunningham</a></b> was also a stunt double in the <i id=\"mwFg\">James Bond</i> film <i id=\"mwFw\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_of_Solace\" title=\"Quantum of Solace\" id=\"mwGA\">Quantum of Solace</a></i><span style=\"padding-left:0.15em;\" about=\"#mwt18\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-mw=\"{&quot;parts&quot;:[{&quot;template&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;wt&quot;:&quot;-?&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;./Template:-%3F&quot;},&quot;params&quot;:{},&quot;i&quot;:0}}]}\" id=\"mwGQ\"><span typeof=\"mw:Entity\">?</span></span>","text":"... that racing driver Neil Cunningham was also a stunt double in the James Bond film Quantum of Solace?"},{"html":"... that, during the 2012 <b id=\"mwGw\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer_Cruise\" title=\"Weezer Cruise\" id=\"mwHA\">Weezer Cruise</a></b>, band members oversaw wedding vow renewals, a shuffleboard contest, a midnight movie screening, and a 1980s-themed prom?","text":"... that, during the 2012 Weezer Cruise, band members oversaw wedding vow renewals, a shuffleboard contest, a midnight movie screening, and a 1980s-themed prom?"},{"html":"... that <b id=\"mwHg\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Royal_Challengers_Bengaluru_season\" title=\"2025 Royal Challengers Bengaluru season\" id=\"mwHw\">in 2025, Royal Challengers Bengaluru</a></b> became the first in the Indian Premier League to win all away games in a season?","text":"... that in 2025, Royal Challengers Bengaluru became the first in the Indian Premier League to win all away games in a season?"},{"html":"... that singer <b id=\"mwIQ\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoo_(singer)\" title=\"Tomoo (singer)\" id=\"mwIg\">Tomoo</a></b> was once unhappy with her performance in a singing contest, despite being chosen as one of its finalists?","text":"... that singer Tomoo was once unhappy with her performance in a singing contest, despite being chosen as one of its finalists?"},{"html":"... that more than 50 planned speakers <b id=\"mwJA\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendigo_Writers_Festival_boycott\" title=\"Bendigo Writers Festival boycott\" id=\"mwJQ\">boycotted the Bendigo Writers Festival</a></b> over its code of conduct?","text":"... that more than 50 planned speakers boycotted the Bendigo Writers Festival over its code of conduct?"},{"html":"... that <b id=\"mwJw\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshi_Abe's_home_page\" title=\"Hiroshi Abe's home page\" id=\"mwKA\">the personal website of an actor</a></b> is used for benchmarking newly released gadgets?","text":"... that the personal website of an actor is used for benchmarking newly released gadgets?"},{"html":"... that <b id=\"mwKg\"><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikael_Genberg\" title=\"Mikael Genberg\" id=\"mwKw\">Mikael Genberg</a></b> has sent a house to the Moon?","text":"... that Mikael Genberg has sent a house to the Moon?"}]}
