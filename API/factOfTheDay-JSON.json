Tracing its origins to 1 August 1907, as a part of the United States Army Signal Corps, the USAF was established by transfer of personnel from the Army Air Forces with the enactment of the National Security Act of 1947. It is the second youngest branch of the United States Armed Forces and the fourth in order of precedence. The United States Air Force articulates its core missions as air supremacy, global integrated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, rapid global mobility, global strike, and command and control.</p>","normalizedtitle":"United States Air Force"},{"type":"standard","title":"Guided_bomb","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Guided bomb</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q13494477","titles":{"canonical":"Guided_bomb","normalized":"Guided bomb","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Guided bomb</span>"},"pageid":3587974,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/BOLT117LGB.jpg/320px-BOLT117LGB.jpg","width":320,"height":110},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/BOLT117LGB.jpg","width":1985,"height":682},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1270770986","tid":"b142ce0d-d7ae-11ef-a7d8-ff37d1aa1404","timestamp":"2025-01-21T04:17:57Z","description":"Bomb controllable from an external device","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_bomb","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_bomb?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_bomb?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Guided_bomb"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_bomb","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Guided_bomb","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_bomb?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Guided_bomb"}},"extract":"A guided bomb is a precision-guided munition designed to achieve a smaller circular error probable (CEP).","extract_html":"<p>A <b>guided bomb</b> is a precision-guided munition designed to achieve a smaller circular error probable (CEP).</p>","normalizedtitle":"Guided bomb"},{"type":"standard","title":"Air_raid_shelter","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Air raid shelter</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q389959","titles":{"canonical":"Air_raid_shelter","normalized":"Air raid shelter","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Air raid shelter</span>"},"pageid":444794,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Belsize_Park_deep_level_shelter_1.jpg/320px-Belsize_Park_deep_level_shelter_1.jpg","width":320,"height":216},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Belsize_Park_deep_level_shelter_1.jpg","width":800,"height":539},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1274713903","tid":"e336b88a-e661-11ef-88f8-44029eedae5e","timestamp":"2025-02-08T21:15:57Z","description":"Fortified wartime structures which protect citizens from airborne attacks","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raid_shelter","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raid_shelter?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raid_shelter?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Air_raid_shelter"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raid_shelter","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Air_raid_shelter","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raid_shelter?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Air_raid_shelter"}},"extract":"Air raid shelters are structures for the protection of non-combatants as well as combatants against enemy attacks from the air.

A spark plug has a metal threaded shell, electrically isolated from a central electrode by a ceramic insulator. The central electrode, which may contain a resistor, is connected by a heavily insulated wire to the output terminal of an ignition coil or magneto. The spark plug's metal shell is screwed into the engine's cylinder head and thus electrically grounded.
