Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions. Lightning is an atmospheric electrical phenomenon and contributes to the global atmospheric electrical circuit.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Lightning"}],"year":1752},{"text":"The Spanish ship San Felipe was shipwrecked on the Japanese island of Shikoku, and its cargo confiscated by the local daimyō.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"San_Felipe_incident_(1596)","displaytitle":"<i>San Felipe</i> incident (1596)","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q11306135","titles":{"canonical":"San_Felipe_incident_(1596)","normalized":"San Felipe incident (1596)","display":"<i>San Felipe</i> incident (1596)"},"pageid":55929455,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Calvary-of-Nagasaki-1597-by-Eustaquio-Maria-de-Nenclares-%281862%29.png/320px-Calvary-of-Nagasaki-1597-by-Eustaquio-Maria-de-Nenclares-%281862%29.png","width":320,"height":219},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Calvary-of-Nagasaki-1597-by-Eustaquio-Maria-de-Nenclares-%281862%29.png","width":3619,"height":2479},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1249287714","tid":"93555f69-8207-11ef-96dd-61c86ae6c471","timestamp":"2024-10-04T04:17:32Z","description":"Spanish shipwreck in Japan with political consequences","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Felipe_incident_(1596)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Felipe_incident_(1596)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Felipe_incident_(1596)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:San_Felipe_incident_(1596)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Felipe_incident_(1596)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/San_Felipe_incident_(1596)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Felipe_incident_(1596)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:San_Felipe_incident_(1596)"}},"extract":"\n\nOn October 19, 1596, the Spanish ship San Felipe was shipwrecked on Urado in Kōchi on the Japanese island of Shikoku en route from Manila to Acapulco in the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade.
