Headquartered in Washington, D.C., NASA operates ten field centers across the United States and is organized into mission directorates for Science, Space Operations, Exploration Systems Development, Space Technology, Aeronautics Research, and Mission Support. Established in 1958, NASA succeeded the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to give the American space development effort a distinct civilian orientation, emphasizing peaceful applications in space science. It has since led most of America's space exploration programs, including Project Mercury, Project Gemini, the 1968–1972 Apollo program missions, the Skylab space station, and the Space Shuttle.</p>","normalizedtitle":"NASA"},{"type":"standard","title":"Voyager_1","displaytitle":"<i>Voyager 1</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q48469","titles":{"canonical":"Voyager_1","normalized":"Voyager 1","display":"<i>Voyager 1</i>"},"pageid":32781,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Voyager_spacecraft_model.png/330px-Voyager_spacecraft_model.png","width":330,"height":239},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Voyager_spacecraft_model.png","width":1700,"height":1233},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1335988432","tid":"dc2b3798-ff49-11f0-966e-66c10927bb18","timestamp":"2026-02-01T08:41:54Z","description":"NASA space probe launched in 1977","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Voyager_1"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Voyager_1","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Voyager_1"}},"extract":"Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977, as part of the Voyager program, to study the outer Solar System and the interstellar space beyond the Sun's heliosphere.

A radioactive metal, lawrencium is the eleventh transuranium element, the third transfermium, and the last member of the actinide series. Like all elements with atomic number over 100, lawrencium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. Fourteen isotopes of lawrencium are known; the most stable is <sup>266</sup>Lr with half-life 11 hours, but the shorter-lived <sup>260</sup>Lr is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Lawrencium"},{"type":"standard","title":"Synthetic_element","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Synthetic element</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q755992","titles":{"canonical":"Synthetic_element","normalized":"Synthetic element","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Synthetic element</span>"},"pageid":29365,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Redgreen_colorblind_changed_version_of_Synthetic_Mod.png/330px-Redgreen_colorblind_changed_version_of_Synthetic_Mod.png","width":330,"height":224},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Redgreen_colorblind_changed_version_of_Synthetic_Mod.png","width":1200,"height":816},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1306570133","tid":"b29b7e3b-7c39-11f0-aeda-1f1f7c7e089e","timestamp":"2025-08-18T13:46:10Z","description":"Chemical elements that do not occur naturally","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_element","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_element?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_element?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Synthetic_element"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_element","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Synthetic_element","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_element?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Synthetic_element"}},"extract":"A synthetic element is a known chemical element that does not occur naturally on Earth: it has been created by human manipulation of fundamental particles in a nuclear reactor, a particle accelerator, or the explosion of an atomic bomb; thus, it is called \"synthetic\", \"artificial\", or \"man-made\".
