Dominated by the leaders of Britain, France, the United States and Italy, the conference resulted in five treaties that rearranged the maps of Europe and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands, and also imposed financial penalties. Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and the other losing nations were not given a voice in the deliberations; this later gave rise to political resentments that lasted decades. The arrangements made by this conference are considered one of the greatest watersheds of 20th century geopolitical history which would lead to World War II.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)"}],"year":1919},{"text":"The Royal Navy battleship HMS Dreadnought was launched, representing such a marked advance in naval technology that her name came to be associated with an entire generation of battleships.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Royal_Navy","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Royal Navy</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q172771","titles":{"canonical":"Royal_Navy","normalized":"Royal Navy","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Royal Navy</span>"},"pageid":26061,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Logo_of_the_Royal_Navy.svg/330px-Logo_of_the_Royal_Navy.svg.png","width":330,"height":399},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Logo_of_the_Royal_Navy.svg/330px-Logo_of_the_Royal_Navy.svg.png","width":287,"height":347},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1337458601","tid":"b220e5b7-05d1-11f1-8b5f-40c8b0536b44","timestamp":"2026-02-09T16:09:22Z","description":"Naval warfare force of the United Kingdom","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Royal_Navy"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Royal_Navy","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Royal_Navy"}},"extract":"The Royal Navy (RN) is the naval warfare force of the United Kingdom, responsible for defending the UK, the Crown Dependencies, and the Overseas Territories from naval attack or invasion.
