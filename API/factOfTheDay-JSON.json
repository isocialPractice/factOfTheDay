Although originally established to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, the university primarily trained Congregationalist ministers during its early history before it gradually secularized. Emerging into national prominence at the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth was considered to be the most prestigious undergraduate college in the United States in the early 1900s. While Dartmouth is now a research university rather than simply an undergraduate college, it continues to go by \"Dartmouth College\" to emphasize its focus on undergraduate education.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Dartmouth College"},{"type":"standard","title":"Royal_charter","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Royal charter</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1422253","titles":{"canonical":"Royal_charter","normalized":"Royal charter","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Royal charter</span>"},"pageid":100943,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/King%27s_College_royal_charter_1827_leaf1.jpg/320px-King%27s_College_royal_charter_1827_leaf1.jpg","width":320,"height":263},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/King%27s_College_royal_charter_1827_leaf1.jpg","width":1659,"height":1363},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1183044507","tid":"a02f70d0-92df-11ee-9f40-73c007cfa776","timestamp":"2023-11-01T21:48:14Z","description":"Document granting rights from a monarch","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_charter","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_charter?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_charter?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Royal_charter"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_charter","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Royal_charter","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_charter?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Royal_charter"}},"extract":"A royal charter is a formal grant issued by a monarch under royal prerogative as letters patent.
