Habsburg and Württemberg regulars numbering 40,000, under the command of Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, besieged and captured the French-controlled fortifications at the village of Kehl in the German state of Baden-Durlach. The fortifications at Kehl represented an important bridgehead crossing the Rhine to Strasbourg, an Alsatian city and a French Revolutionary stronghold. This battle was part of the Rhine Campaign of 1796, in the French Revolutionary War of the First Coalition.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Siege of Kehl (1796–1797)"},{"type":"standard","title":"Habsburg_monarchy","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Habsburg monarchy</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q153136","titles":{"canonical":"Habsburg_monarchy","normalized":"Habsburg monarchy","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Habsburg monarchy</span>"},"pageid":1041515,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg/330px-Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg.png","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg/1200px-Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg.png","width":1200,"height":800},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1329693745","tid":"6f5dc486-e32b-11f0-9376-e8512be30c86","timestamp":"2025-12-27T13:53:34Z","description":"Monarchy in Europe (1282–1918)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_monarchy","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_monarchy?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_monarchy?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Habsburg_monarchy"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_monarchy","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Habsburg_monarchy","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_monarchy?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Habsburg_monarchy"}},"extract":"The Habsburg monarchy, also known as Habsburg Empire, or Habsburg Realm, and Danube Monarchy, was the collection of empires, kingdoms, duchies, counties and other polities that were ruled by the House of Habsburg.
