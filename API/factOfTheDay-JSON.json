With a film career spanning Hong Kong and the United States, Lee is regarded as the first global Chinese film star and one of the most influential martial artists in the history of cinema. Known for his roles in five feature-length martial arts films, Lee is credited with helping to popularize martial arts films in the 1970s and promoting Hong Kong action cinema.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Bruce Lee"},{"views":128696,"rank":14,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-11-19Z","views":137158},{"date":"2025-11-20Z","views":137262},{"date":"2025-11-21Z","views":136749},{"date":"2025-11-22Z","views":129703},{"date":"2025-11-23Z","views":128696}],"type":"standard","title":"Deaths_in_2025","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Deaths in 2025</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q131381961","titles":{"canonical":"Deaths_in_2025","normalized":"Deaths in 2025","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Deaths in 2025</span>"},"pageid":75715266,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1323864901","tid":"0af5b25c-c8f2-11f0-9ecd-66b25482db11","timestamp":"2025-11-24T04:57:14Z","description":"","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2025","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2025?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2025?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Deaths_in_2025"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2025","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Deaths_in_2025","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_in_2025?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Deaths_in_2025"}},"extract":"\n\n\n\nThe following notable deaths occurred in 2025.

Irish nationalists during the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries such as the United Irishmen in the 1790s, Young Irelanders in the 1840s, the Fenian Brotherhood during the 1880s, Fianna Fáil in the 1920s, and Sinn Féin styled themselves in various ways after French left-wing radicalism and republicanism.

One account of the scandal called for Canton to win the first game and Massillon to win the second, forcing a third game—with the biggest gate—to be played legitimately, with the 1906 Ohio League championship at stake. Another account accused Wallace and East of bribing Massillon players to throw a game in the series. Canton denied the charges, maintaining that Massillon only wanted to damage the club's reputation. Although Massillon could not prove that Canton had indeed thrown the second game and it remains unknown if there was ever a match-fixing agreement, the scandal tarnished the Bulldogs name and reportedly helped ruin professional football in Ohio until the mid-1910s.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Canton Bulldogs–Massillon Tigers betting scandal"}],"year":1906},{"text":"American Civil War: As part of the Chattanooga campaign in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Union forces captured Lookout Mountain, helping them to begin breaking the Confederate siege of the city.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"American_Civil_War","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">American Civil War</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q8676","titles":{"canonical":"American_Civil_War","normalized":"American Civil War","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">American Civil War</span>"},"pageid":863,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Battle_of_Gettysburg%2C_by_Currier_and_Ives.png/330px-Battle_of_Gettysburg%2C_by_Currier_and_Ives.png","width":320,"height":205},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Battle_of_Gettysburg%2C_by_Currier_and_Ives.png","width":1231,"height":787},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1323647782","tid":"3484e052-c805-11f0-8210-67249e255b83","timestamp":"2025-11-23T00:41:53Z","description":"1861–1865 conflict in the United States","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:American_Civil_War"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/American_Civil_War","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:American_Civil_War"}},"extract":"The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States between the Union and the Confederacy, which was formed in 1861 by states that had seceded from the Union to preserve African American slavery, which they saw as threatened because of the election of Abraham Lincoln and the growing abolitionist movement in the North.","extract_html":"<p>The <b>American Civil War</b> was a civil war in the United States between the Union and the Confederacy, which was formed in 1861 by states that had seceded from the Union to preserve African American slavery, which they saw as threatened because of the election of Abraham Lincoln and the growing abolitionist movement in the North.</p>","normalizedtitle":"American Civil War"},{"type":"standard","title":"Chattanooga_campaign","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Chattanooga campaign</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1477050","titles":{"canonical":"Chattanooga_campaign","normalized":"Chattanooga campaign","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Chattanooga campaign</span>"},"pageid":21079980,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Grant_and_Bragg.jpg/330px-Grant_and_Bragg.jpg","width":320,"height":229},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Grant_and_Bragg.jpg","width":1076,"height":769},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1308823781","tid":"b1396f08-8697-11f0-bfb8-edf0662e055b","timestamp":"2025-08-31T18:24:12Z","description":"1863 series of battles of the American Civil War","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":35.035,"lon":-85.29},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga_campaign","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga_campaign?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga_campaign?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chattanooga_campaign"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga_campaign","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Chattanooga_campaign","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga_campaign?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chattanooga_campaign"}},"extract":"The Chattanooga campaign was a series of maneuvers and battles in October and November 1863, during the American Civil War.
