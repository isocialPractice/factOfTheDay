Known for his roles in five feature-length martial arts films, he is credited with helping to popularize martial arts films in the 1970s and promoting Hong Kong action cinema.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Bruce Lee"},{"views":98617,"rank":33,"view_history":[{"date":"2026-01-27Z","views":135434},{"date":"2026-01-28Z","views":106709},{"date":"2026-01-29Z","views":98548},{"date":"2026-01-30Z","views":137395},{"date":"2026-01-31Z","views":98617}],"type":"standard","title":"Neatsville,_Kentucky","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Neatsville, Kentucky</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q6984524","titles":{"canonical":"Neatsville,_Kentucky","normalized":"Neatsville, Kentucky","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Neatsville, Kentucky</span>"},"pageid":20147376,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1333901408","tid":"95574a0a-f5ef-11f0-a97f-55080375c2d9","timestamp":"2026-01-20T11:03:00Z","description":"Unincorporated community in Kentucky, US","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":37.19722222,"lon":-85.12555556},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neatsville%2C_Kentucky","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neatsville%2C_Kentucky?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neatsville%2C_Kentucky?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neatsville%2C_Kentucky"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neatsville%2C_Kentucky","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Neatsville%2C_Kentucky","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neatsville%2C_Kentucky?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neatsville%2C_Kentucky"}},"extract":"Neatsville is an unincorporated community in Adair County, in the U.S. state of Kentucky.
