Considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, their contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack, large public address systems, the use of synthesizers, Entwistle's and Moon's influential playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by many hard rock, punk, power pop and mod bands. The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.</p>","normalizedtitle":"The Who"},{"type":"standard","title":"Who's_Next","displaytitle":"<i>Who's Next</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q729387","titles":{"canonical":"Who's_Next","normalized":"Who's Next","display":"<i>Who's Next</i>"},"pageid":157547,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Whosnext.jpg","width":300,"height":300},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Whosnext.jpg","width":300,"height":300},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1298177399","tid":"4cb35224-5609-11f0-a6f7-e179aaea2ea6","timestamp":"2025-06-30T23:23:59Z","description":"1971 studio album by the Who","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who's_Next","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who's_Next?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who's_Next?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Who's_Next"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who's_Next","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Who's_Next","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who's_Next?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Who's_Next"}},"extract":"Who's Next is the fifth studio album by the English rock band the Who, released on 2 August 1971, by Track Records in the United Kingdom and by Decca Records in the United States.
