The name originally referred to the albedo feature that was visible from earthbound telescopes. The area borders the plains of Acidalia Planitia and the highlands of Arabia Terra. The region includes the named features Cydonia Mensae, an area of flat-topped mesa-like features; Cydonia Colles, a region of small hills or knobs; and Cydonia Labyrinthus, a complex of intersecting valleys. As with other albedo features on Mars, the name Cydonia was drawn from classical antiquity, in this case from <i>Kydonia</i>, a historic <i>polis</i> on the island of Crete.\nCydonia contains the \"Face on Mars\", located about halfway between the craters Arandas and Bamberg.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Cydonia (Mars)"},{"type":"standard","title":"Pareidolia","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pareidolia</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q506422","titles":{"canonical":"Pareidolia","normalized":"Pareidolia","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Pareidolia</span>"},"pageid":649382,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/107-2-D1_-_Danish_electrical_plugs_-_Studio_2011_%28cropped%29.jpg/320px-107-2-D1_-_Danish_electrical_plugs_-_Studio_2011_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":320,"height":308},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/107-2-D1_-_Danish_electrical_plugs_-_Studio_2011_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":1326,"height":1276},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1236435153","tid":"c26c7447-49e5-11ef-89c6-be977f244cf0","timestamp":"2024-07-24T17:54:23Z","description":"Perception of meaningful patterns or images in random or vague stimuli","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pareidolia"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Pareidolia","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pareidolia"}},"extract":"Pareidolia is the tendency for perception to impose a meaningful interpretation on a nebulous stimulus, usually visual, so that one detects an object, pattern, or meaning where there is none.
