The largest represented leftist party in Congress, Free Peru, has subsequently aligned itself with conservative and Fujimorists parties within Congress due to their institutional power.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Congress of the Republic of Peru"}],"story":"<!--Oct 10--><a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./José_Jerí\" title=\"José Jerí\" id=\"mwBg\">José Jerí</a> <i id=\"mwBw\">(pictured)</i> is sworn in as <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./President_of_Peru\" title=\"President of Peru\" id=\"mwCA\">President of Peru</a> after <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Dina_Boluarte\" title=\"Dina Boluarte\" id=\"mwCQ\">Dina Boluarte</a> <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Impeachment_of_Dina_Boluarte\" title=\"Impeachment of Dina Boluarte\" id=\"mwCg\"><b id=\"mwCw\">is removed from office</b></a> by <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink\" href=\"./Congress_of_the_Republic_of_Peru\" title=\"Congress of the Republic of Peru\" id=\"mwDA\">the Congress</a>."},{"links":[{"type":"standard","title":"María_Corina_Machado","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">María Corina Machado</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q439564","titles":{"canonical":"María_Corina_Machado","normalized":"María Corina Machado","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">María Corina Machado</span>"},"pageid":5791389,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Mar%C3%ADa_Corina_Machado_2023.jpg/330px-Mar%C3%ADa_Corina_Machado_2023.jpg","width":320,"height":420},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Mar%C3%ADa_Corina_Machado_2023.jpg","width":781,"height":1026},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1316492234","tid":"9f28137b-a7a9-11f0-b7cc-08559f0141a0","timestamp":"2025-10-12T20:25:41Z","description":"Venezuelan politician and activist (born 1967)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADa_Corina_Machado","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADa_Corina_Machado?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADa_Corina_Machado?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mar%C3%ADa_Corina_Machado"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADa_Corina_Machado","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Mar%C3%ADa_Corina_Machado","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADa_Corina_Machado?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mar%C3%ADa_Corina_Machado"}},"extract":"María Corina Machado Parisca is a politician, activist and a prominent leader of the Venezuelan opposition to the governments of Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro.
