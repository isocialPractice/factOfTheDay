The party had little popular support until the Great Depression, when worsening living standards and widespread unemployment drove Germans into political extremism.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Nazi Party"},{"type":"standard","title":"Gleichschaltung","displaytitle":"<i>Gleichschaltung</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q313768","titles":{"canonical":"Gleichschaltung","normalized":"Gleichschaltung","display":"<i>Gleichschaltung</i>"},"pageid":12213,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/60/Reichsparteitag_N%C3%BCrnberg_1938_Festpostkarte_%28Nazi_Party_Congress_postcard%29.jpg/330px-Reichsparteitag_N%C3%BCrnberg_1938_Festpostkarte_%28Nazi_Party_Congress_postcard%29.jpg","width":320,"height":451},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/60/Reichsparteitag_N%C3%BCrnberg_1938_Festpostkarte_%28Nazi_Party_Congress_postcard%29.jpg","width":850,"height":1197},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1278296882","tid":"8e63dd0e-f6bb-11ef-ad5c-ed85a702e177","timestamp":"2025-03-01T16:38:08Z","description":"Nazification process of German society","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleichschaltung","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleichschaltung?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleichschaltung?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gleichschaltung"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleichschaltung","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Gleichschaltung","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleichschaltung?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gleichschaltung"}},"extract":"The Nazi term Gleichschaltung, meaning \"synchronization\" or \"bringing into line\", was the process of Nazification by which Adolf Hitler—leader of the Nazi Party in Germany—established a system of totalitarian control and coordination over all aspects of German society \"from the economy and trade associations to the media, culture and education\".","extract_html":"<p>The Nazi term <b><span><i lang=\"de\">Gleichschaltung</i></span></b>, meaning \"<b>synchronization</b>\" or \"<b>bringing into line</b>\", was the process of <b>Nazification</b> by which Adolf Hitler—leader of the Nazi Party in Germany—established a system of totalitarian control and coordination over all aspects of German society \"from the economy and trade associations to the media, culture and education\".</p>","normalizedtitle":"Gleichschaltung"},{"type":"standard","title":"Enabling_Act_of_1933","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Enabling Act of 1933</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q310218","titles":{"canonical":"Enabling_Act_of_1933","normalized":"Enabling Act of 1933","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Enabling Act of 1933</span>"},"pageid":218116,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-14439%2C_Rede_Adolf_Hitlers_zum_Erm%C3%A4chtigungsgesetz.jpg/320px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-14439%2C_Rede_Adolf_Hitlers_zum_Erm%C3%A4chtigungsgesetz.jpg","width":320,"height":220},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-14439%2C_Rede_Adolf_Hitlers_zum_Erm%C3%A4chtigungsgesetz.jpg","width":800,"height":551},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1281865232","tid":"a687e4b3-0774-11f0-bfff-d34a60c471cf","timestamp":"2025-03-22T23:23:24Z","description":"Transfer of the Reichstag's power to the government under Hitler","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Enabling_Act_of_1933"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Enabling_Act_of_1933","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Enabling_Act_of_1933"}},"extract":"The Enabling Act of 1933, was a law that gave the German Cabinet – most importantly, the Chancellor, Adolf Hitler – the power to make and enforce laws without the involvement of the Reichstag or President Paul von Hindenburg.
