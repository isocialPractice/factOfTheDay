Located in Melanesia in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, the island is separated from Australia by the 150-kilometre wide Torres Strait, though both landmasses lie on the same continental shelf, and were united during episodes of low sea level in the Pleistocene glaciations as the combined landmass of Sahul. Numerous smaller islands are located to the west and east. The island's name was given by Spanish explorer Yñigo Ortiz de Retez during his maritime expedition of 1545 due to the perceived resemblance of the indigenous peoples of the island to those in the African region of Guinea.</p>","normalizedtitle":"New Guinea"}],"year":1606},{"text":"According to Ptolemy, the reign of the Babylonian king Nabonassar (name in Akkadian pictured) began, marking a new era characterized by the systematic maintenance of chronologically precise historical records.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"740s_BC","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">740s BC</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q286290","titles":{"canonical":"740s_BC","normalized":"740s BC","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">740s BC</span>"},"pageid":52173,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1258432812","tid":"a632da36-a6a3-11ef-afc6-3753e0e04e77","timestamp":"2024-11-19T18:25:27Z","description":"Decade","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/740s_BC","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/740s_BC?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/740s_BC?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:740s_BC"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/740s_BC","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/740s_BC","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/740s_BC?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:740s_BC"}},"extract":"This article concerns the period 749 BC – 740 BC.","extract_html":"<p>This article concerns the period <b>749 BC – 740 BC</b>.</p>","normalizedtitle":"740s BC"},{"type":"standard","title":"Ptolemy","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ptolemy</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q34943","titles":{"canonical":"Ptolemy","normalized":"Ptolemy","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ptolemy</span>"},"pageid":23979,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Ptolemy_1476_with_armillary_sphere_model.jpg/320px-Ptolemy_1476_with_armillary_sphere_model.jpg","width":320,"height":471},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Ptolemy_1476_with_armillary_sphere_model.jpg","width":1020,"height":1500},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1277474472","tid":"b4713493-f2f5-11ef-bc07-5aa54c472f1e","timestamp":"2025-02-24T21:24:18Z","description":"Roman astronomer and geographer (c. 100–170)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ptolemy"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Ptolemy","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ptolemy"}},"extract":"Claudius Ptolemy was an Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, geographer, and music theorist who wrote about a dozen scientific treatises, three of which were important to later Byzantine, Islamic, and Western European science.
