Located in Northern Taiwan, Taipei City is an enclave of the municipality of New Taipei City that sits about 25 km (16 mi) southwest of the northern port city of Keelung. Most of the city rests on the Taipei Basin, an ancient lakebed. The basin is bounded by the relatively narrow valleys of the Keelung and Xindian rivers, which join to form the Tamsui River along the city's western border.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Taipei"},{"type":"standard","title":"Kaohsiung","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Kaohsiung</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q181557","titles":{"canonical":"Kaohsiung","normalized":"Kaohsiung","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Kaohsiung</span>"},"pageid":17015,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Kaohsiung_Skyline_2020_%28cropped%29.jpg/320px-Kaohsiung_Skyline_2020_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":320,"height":160},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Kaohsiung_Skyline_2020_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":3236,"height":1619},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1266147939","tid":"87ebbcac-c688-11ef-90a2-db9e6a8538ff","timestamp":"2024-12-30T08:31:57Z","description":"City in southern Taiwan","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":22.615,"lon":120.2975},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaohsiung","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaohsiung?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaohsiung?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kaohsiung"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaohsiung","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Kaohsiung","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaohsiung?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kaohsiung"}},"extract":"Kaohsiung, officially Kaohsiung City, is a special municipality located in southern Taiwan.

Truman</b> was the 33rd president of the United States, serving from 1945 to 1953. A member of the Democratic Party, he assumed the presidency after Franklin D. Roosevelt's death, as he was vice president at the time. Truman implemented the Marshall Plan in the wake of World War II to rebuild the economy of Western Europe and established both the Truman Doctrine and NATO to contain the expansion of Soviet communism. He proposed numerous liberal domestic reforms, but few were enacted by the conservative coalition that dominated Congress.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Harry S.

Some early Māori moved to the Chatham Islands, where their descendants became New Zealand's other indigenous Polynesian ethnic group, the Moriori.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Māori people"},{"type":"standard","title":"Te_Kooti","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Te Kooti</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q737045","titles":{"canonical":"Te_Kooti","normalized":"Te Kooti","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Te Kooti</span>"},"pageid":172022,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1258554624","tid":"14b772b0-a724-11ef-a710-f0d3c9394834","timestamp":"2024-11-20T09:44:48Z","description":"New Zealand Māori leader","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_Kooti","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_Kooti?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_Kooti?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Te_Kooti"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_Kooti","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Te_Kooti","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_Kooti?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Te_Kooti"}},"extract":"\n\nTe Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki was a Māori leader, the founder of the Ringatū religion and guerrilla fighter.","extract_html":"<p>\n\n<b>Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki</b> was a Māori leader, the founder of the Ringatū religion and guerrilla fighter.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Te Kooti"},{"type":"standard","title":"New_Zealand_Defence_Force","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">New Zealand Defence Force</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1051650","titles":{"canonical":"New_Zealand_Defence_Force","normalized":"New Zealand Defence Force","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">New Zealand Defence Force</span>"},"pageid":21359,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1264107624","tid":"c93bfb27-bedc-11ef-9e27-3c0b3c5cf83a","timestamp":"2024-12-20T14:14:55Z","description":"Combined military forces of New Zealand","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Defence_Force","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Defence_Force?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Defence_Force?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:New_Zealand_Defence_Force"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Defence_Force","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/New_Zealand_Defence_Force","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Defence_Force?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:New_Zealand_Defence_Force"}},"extract":"The New Zealand Defence Force is the three-branched military of New Zealand.
