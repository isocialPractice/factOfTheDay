Sadler was killed when his balloon crashed into a chimney near Blackburn during a flight in 1824.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Windham William Sadler"},{"type":"standard","title":"Irish_Sea","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Irish Sea</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q41735","titles":{"canonical":"Irish_Sea","normalized":"Irish Sea","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Irish Sea</span>"},"pageid":23248420,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Irish_Sea_satellite_image.jpg/330px-Irish_Sea_satellite_image.jpg","width":320,"height":423},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Irish_Sea_satellite_image.jpg","width":436,"height":576},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1285477806","tid":"a0d852b5-18ba-11f0-b37d-acffadbca894","timestamp":"2025-04-13T22:57:09Z","description":"Sea between Ireland and Great Britain","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":53.5,"lon":-5},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Sea","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Sea?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Sea?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Irish_Sea"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Sea","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Irish_Sea","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Sea?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Irish_Sea"}},"extract":"The Irish Sea is a 46,007 km2 (17,763 sq mi) body of water that separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain.
