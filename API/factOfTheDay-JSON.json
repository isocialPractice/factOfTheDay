The word \"decathlon\" was formed, in analogy to the word \"pentathlon\", from Greek δέκα and ἄθλος. Events are held over two consecutive days and the winners are determined by the combined performance in all. Performance is judged on a points system in each event, not by the position achieved. The decathlon is contested mainly by male athletes, while female athletes typically compete in the heptathlon.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Decathlon"},{"views":252409,"rank":11,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-07-30Z","views":236520},{"date":"2024-07-31Z","views":451478},{"date":"2024-08-01Z","views":668007},{"date":"2024-08-02Z","views":349347},{"date":"2024-08-03Z","views":252409}],"type":"standard","title":"Kamala_Harris","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Kamala Harris</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q10853588","titles":{"canonical":"Kamala_Harris","normalized":"Kamala Harris","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Kamala Harris</span>"},"pageid":3120522,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Kamala_Harris_Vice_Presidential_Portrait.jpg/320px-Kamala_Harris_Vice_Presidential_Portrait.jpg","width":320,"height":400},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Kamala_Harris_Vice_Presidential_Portrait.jpg","width":2400,"height":3000},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1238478965","tid":"d4330864-520b-11ef-81f5-baee6ecfc34c","timestamp":"2024-08-04T02:47:03Z","description":"Vice President of the United States since 2021","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kamala_Harris"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Kamala_Harris","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kamala_Harris"}},"extract":"Kamala Devi Harris is an American politician and attorney who is the 49th and current vice president of the United States since 2021 under President Joe Biden.
