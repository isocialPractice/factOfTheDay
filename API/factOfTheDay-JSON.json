From 1901 to 1912, Colorado Fuel and Iron was one of the Dow Jones Industrials. The steel-market crash of 1982 led to the decline of the company. After going through several bankruptcies, the company was acquired by Oregon Steel Mills in 1993, and changed its name to Rocky Mountain Steel Mills. In January 2007, Rocky Mountain Steel Mills, along with the rest of Oregon Steel's holdings, were acquired by EVRAZ Group, a Russian steel corporation, for $2.3 billion.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Colorado Fuel and Iron"},{"type":"standard","title":"Colorado_Coalfield_War","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Colorado Coalfield War</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q5148759","titles":{"canonical":"Colorado_Coalfield_War","normalized":"Colorado Coalfield War","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Colorado Coalfield War</span>"},"pageid":36165974,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Armed_Strikers_at_Ludlow%2C_Colorado%2C_c._1914.png/320px-Armed_Strikers_at_Ludlow%2C_Colorado%2C_c._1914.png","width":320,"height":220},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Armed_Strikers_at_Ludlow%2C_Colorado%2C_c._1914.png","width":2362,"height":1622},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1245730678","tid":"709cfded-72cc-11ef-b81b-d686665b9d3c","timestamp":"2024-09-14T19:06:26Z","description":"1913–1914 labor uprising","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Coalfield_War","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Coalfield_War?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Coalfield_War?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Colorado_Coalfield_War"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Coalfield_War","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Colorado_Coalfield_War","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Coalfield_War?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Colorado_Coalfield_War"}},"extract":"The Colorado Coalfield War was a major labor uprising in the southern and central Colorado Front Range between September 1913 and December 1914.
