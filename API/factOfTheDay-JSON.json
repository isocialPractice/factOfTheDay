Inscribed the <i>Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup</i>, the trophy was first awarded to Canada's amateur ice hockey clubs who won the trophy as the result of challenge games and league play. Professional clubs came to dominate the competition in the early years of the twentieth century, and in 1913 the two major professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA), forerunner of the NHL, and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other in an annual series for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, it became the <i>de facto</i> championship trophy of the NHL in 1926, though it was nominally still subject to external challenge. After 1947, the Cup became the <i>de jure</i> NHL championship prize.</p>","normalizedtitle":"List of Stanley Cup champions"},{"views":67208,"rank":29,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-05-26Z","views":14650},{"date":"2025-05-27Z","views":13459},{"date":"2025-05-28Z","views":12563},{"date":"2025-05-29Z","views":25586},{"date":"2025-05-30Z","views":67208}],"type":"standard","title":"Sydney_Sweeney","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Sydney Sweeney</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q49561909","titles":{"canonical":"Sydney_Sweeney","normalized":"Sydney Sweeney","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Sydney Sweeney</span>"},"pageid":56636819,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Sydney_Sweeney_at_the_2024_Toronto_International_Film_Festival_%28cropped%2C_rotated%29.jpg/330px-Sydney_Sweeney_at_the_2024_Toronto_International_Film_Festival_%28cropped%2C_rotated%29.jpg","width":320,"height":481},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Sydney_Sweeney_at_the_2024_Toronto_International_Film_Festival_%28cropped%2C_rotated%29.jpg","width":1228,"height":1844},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1291532382","tid":"e50dff10-3683-11f0-9e93-e4e1c8b7d1d6","timestamp":"2025-05-21T20:40:56Z","description":"American actress (born 1997)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Sweeney","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Sweeney?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Sweeney?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sydney_Sweeney"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Sweeney","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Sydney_Sweeney","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Sweeney?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sydney_Sweeney"}},"extract":"Sydney Bernice Sweeney is an American actress.

The tornado initially touched down at 6:03 p.m. Central Daylight Time (2303 UTC) about 8.3 miles (13.4 km) west-southwest of El Reno, rapidly growing in size and becoming more violent as it tracked through central portions of Canadian County. Remaining over mostly open terrain, the tornado did not impact many structures; however, measurements from mobile weather radars revealed extreme winds in excess of 313 mph (504 km/h) within the vortex. These are among the highest observed wind speeds on Earth, just slightly lower than the wind speeds of the 1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado. As it crossed U.S. 81, it had grown to a record-breaking width of 2.6 miles (4.2 km), beating the previous width record set in 2004. Turning northeastward, the tornado soon weakened. Upon crossing Interstate 40, the tornado dissipated around 6:43 p.m. CDT (2343 UTC), after tracking for 16.2 miles (26.1 km). It avoided affecting the more densely populated areas near and within the Oklahoma City metropolitan area.","extract_html":"<p>The <b>2013 El Reno tornado</b> was an extremely large, powerful, and erratic tornado that occurred over rural areas of Central Oklahoma during the early evening hours of Friday, May 31, 2013. This rain-wrapped, multiple-vortex tornado was the widest tornado ever recorded and was part of a larger weather system that produced dozens of tornadoes over the preceding days. The tornado initially touched down at 6:03 p.m. Central Daylight Time (2303 UTC) about 8.3 miles (13.4 km) west-southwest of El Reno, rapidly growing in size and becoming more violent as it tracked through central portions of Canadian County. Remaining over mostly open terrain, the tornado did not impact many structures; however, measurements from mobile weather radars revealed extreme winds in excess of 313 mph (504 km/h) within the vortex. These are among the highest observed wind speeds on Earth, just slightly lower than the wind speeds of the 1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado. As it crossed U.S. 81, it had grown to a record-breaking width of 2.6 miles (4.2 km), beating the previous width record set in 2004. Turning northeastward, the tornado soon weakened. Upon crossing Interstate 40, the tornado dissipated around 6:43 p.m. CDT (2343 UTC), after tracking for 16.2 miles (26.1 km). It avoided affecting the more densely populated areas near and within the Oklahoma City metropolitan area.</p>","normalizedtitle":"2013 El Reno tornado"},{"type":"standard","title":"Central_Oklahoma","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Central Oklahoma</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q5061549","titles":{"canonical":"Central_Oklahoma","normalized":"Central Oklahoma","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Central Oklahoma</span>"},"pageid":6153646,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Oklahoma_city_downtown.JPG/330px-Oklahoma_city_downtown.JPG","width":320,"height":189},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Oklahoma_city_downtown.JPG","width":3553,"height":2094},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1220618915","tid":"36806c5f-0287-11ef-9582-7e3ba6aafc48","timestamp":"2024-04-24T22:08:43Z","description":"Region in the state of Oklahoma, United States","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":35.5,"lon":-97.5},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Oklahoma","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Oklahoma?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Oklahoma?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Central_Oklahoma"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Oklahoma","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Central_Oklahoma","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Oklahoma?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Central_Oklahoma"}},"extract":"Central Oklahoma is the geographical name for the central region of the U.S. state of Oklahoma.
