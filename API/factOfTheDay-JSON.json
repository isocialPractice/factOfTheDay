The signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids depend on the type present. Internal hemorrhoids often result in painless, bright red rectal bleeding when defecating. External hemorrhoids often result in pain and swelling in the area of the anus. If bleeding occurs, it is usually darker. Symptoms frequently get better after a few days. A skin tag may remain after the healing of an external hemorrhoid.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Hemorrhoid"},{"views":85802,"rank":26,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-02-24Z","views":2908},{"date":"2024-02-25Z","views":3263},{"date":"2024-02-26Z","views":3953},{"date":"2024-02-27Z","views":4405},{"date":"2024-02-28Z","views":85802}],"type":"standard","title":"Mitch_McConnell","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mitch McConnell</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q355522","titles":{"canonical":"Mitch_McConnell","normalized":"Mitch McConnell","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mitch McConnell</span>"},"pageid":350567,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Mitch_McConnell_2016_official_photo_%281%29.jpg/320px-Mitch_McConnell_2016_official_photo_%281%29.jpg","width":320,"height":441},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Mitch_McConnell_2016_official_photo_%281%29.jpg","width":1696,"height":2335},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1210940641","tid":"26d0a460-d6b0-11ee-8c9c-33e6e1d196b6","timestamp":"2024-02-29T01:53:22Z","description":"American politician and lawyer (born 1942)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mitch_McConnell"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Mitch_McConnell","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mitch_McConnell"}},"extract":"Addison Mitchell McConnell III is an American politician and retired attorney who has served as Senate Minority Leader since 2021 and the senior United States senator from Kentucky since 1985.
