In February 1406, James was forced to take refuge in the castle of the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth after his escort was attacked by supporters of Archibald, 4th Earl of Douglas. He remained there until mid-March, when he boarded a vessel bound for France. On 22 March, English pirates captured the ship and delivered the prince to Henry IV of England. The ailing Robert III died on 4 April, and the 11-year-old James, now the uncrowned King of Scotland, would not regain his freedom for another eighteen years.</p>","normalizedtitle":"James I of Scotland"},{"type":"standard","title":"Perth,_Scotland","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Perth, Scotland</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q203000","titles":{"canonical":"Perth,_Scotland","normalized":"Perth, Scotland","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Perth, Scotland</span>"},"pageid":58730,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Perth_Concert_Hall%2C_Perth%2C_Scotland.jpg/330px-Perth_Concert_Hall%2C_Perth%2C_Scotland.jpg","width":330,"height":248},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Perth_Concert_Hall%2C_Perth%2C_Scotland.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1337716029","tid":"99a5ed3a-06ed-11f1-b3bd-2102d0a3a559","timestamp":"2026-02-11T02:01:38Z","description":"City in central Scotland","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":56.39583333,"lon":-3.43333333},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth%2C_Scotland","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth%2C_Scotland?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth%2C_Scotland?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Perth%2C_Scotland"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth%2C_Scotland","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Perth%2C_Scotland","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth%2C_Scotland?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Perth%2C_Scotland"}},"extract":"Perth is a centrally located Scottish city, on the banks of the River Tay.
