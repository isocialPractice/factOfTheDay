He was killed in the battle fighting his brother, who went on to defeat Vladislav, too, and gained the Serbian throne as Stefan Uroš III, better known as Stefan Dečanski.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Stefan Konstantin"}],"year":1322},{"text":"Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon monarch before the Norman Conquest, was crowned King of England.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Harold_Godwinson","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Harold Godwinson</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q159597","titles":{"canonical":"Harold_Godwinson","normalized":"Harold Godwinson","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Harold Godwinson</span>"},"pageid":40148,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Bayeux_tapestry_stitches_detail..jpg/320px-Bayeux_tapestry_stitches_detail..jpg","width":320,"height":269},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Bayeux_tapestry_stitches_detail..jpg","width":612,"height":515},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1263877108","tid":"cf887a90-bdbf-11ef-99d3-955844bd021a","timestamp":"2024-12-19T04:14:59Z","description":"Anglo-Saxon King of England (r. 1066)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Godwinson","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Godwinson?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Godwinson?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Harold_Godwinson"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Godwinson","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Harold_Godwinson","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Godwinson?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Harold_Godwinson"}},"extract":"Harold Godwinson, also called Harold II, was the last crowned Anglo-Saxon English king.
