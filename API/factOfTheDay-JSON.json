The monument, consisting of a 115-foot (35 m) marble tower, honors the evacuation of Boston during the American Revolutionary War, an early American victory in the conflict. The monument is located near where George Washington ordered the construction of a redoubt, an area which has since been developed as a public park. It was designed by the architectural firm of Peabody &amp; Stearns and was dedicated on March 17, 1902.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Dorchester Heights Monument"},{"type":"standard","title":"Siege_of_Boston","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Siege of Boston</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q815128","titles":{"canonical":"Siege_of_Boston","normalized":"Siege of Boston","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Siege of Boston</span>"},"pageid":239035,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/The_evacuation_of_Boston.jpg/320px-The_evacuation_of_Boston.jpg","width":320,"height":209},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/The_evacuation_of_Boston.jpg","width":760,"height":497},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1212568601","tid":"28b776f0-dd59-11ee-8551-1029d534723e","timestamp":"2024-03-08T14:35:50Z","description":"1775–76 American Revolutionary War campaign","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":42.36333333,"lon":-71.05777778},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Boston","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Boston?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Boston?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Siege_of_Boston"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Boston","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Siege_of_Boston","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Boston?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Siege_of_Boston"}},"extract":"The siege of Boston was the opening phase of the American Revolutionary War.
