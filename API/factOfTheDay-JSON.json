The Olympic disciplines are men's singles, women's singles, pair skating, and ice dance; the four individual disciplines are also combined into a team event, which was first included in the Winter Olympics in 2014. The non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating, Theater on Ice, and four skating. From intermediate through senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs, which, depending on the discipline, may include spins, jumps, moves in the field, lifts, throw jumps, death spirals, and other elements or moves.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Figure skating"},{"type":"standard","title":"Nancy_Kerrigan","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Nancy Kerrigan</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q239988","titles":{"canonical":"Nancy_Kerrigan","normalized":"Nancy Kerrigan","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Nancy Kerrigan</span>"},"pageid":332815,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Nancy_Kerrigan_1995.jpg/320px-Nancy_Kerrigan_1995.jpg","width":320,"height":481},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Nancy_Kerrigan_1995.jpg","width":1530,"height":2299},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1191025662","tid":"afac6fa0-9fb3-11ee-9a68-a336934d475b","timestamp":"2023-12-21T03:47:33Z","description":"American figure skater (born 1969)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Kerrigan","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Kerrigan?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Kerrigan?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nancy_Kerrigan"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Kerrigan","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Nancy_Kerrigan","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Kerrigan?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nancy_Kerrigan"}},"extract":"Nancy Ann Kerrigan is an American former figure skater.

The concept of political freedom is closely connected with the concepts of civil liberties and human rights, which in democratic societies are usually afforded legal protection from the state.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Political freedom"}],"year":1941},{"text":"German geophysicist Alfred Wegener presented his theory of continental drift, the precursor of plate tectonics.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Alfred_Wegener","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Alfred Wegener</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q76323","titles":{"canonical":"Alfred_Wegener","normalized":"Alfred Wegener","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Alfred Wegener</span>"},"pageid":1331018,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Alfred_Wegener_ca.1924-30.jpg/320px-Alfred_Wegener_ca.1924-30.jpg","width":320,"height":387},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Alfred_Wegener_ca.1924-30.jpg","width":1224,"height":1480},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1193182714","tid":"99638240-a974-11ee-908f-89271ab7d51e","timestamp":"2024-01-02T13:41:11Z","description":"German climatologist and geophysicist (1880–1930)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Alfred_Wegener"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Alfred_Wegener","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Alfred_Wegener"}},"extract":"Alfred Lothar Wegener was a German climatologist, geologist, geophysicist, meteorologist, and polar researcher.","extract_html":"<p><b>Alfred Lothar Wegener</b> was a German climatologist, geologist, geophysicist, meteorologist, and polar researcher.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Alfred Wegener"},{"type":"standard","title":"Continental_drift","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Continental drift</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q178605","titles":{"canonical":"Continental_drift","normalized":"Continental drift","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Continental drift</span>"},"pageid":6056,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1184491846","tid":"54cb52e0-a990-11ee-b278-abb3235f1403","timestamp":"2023-11-10T19:21:25Z","description":"Movement of Earth's continents relative to each other","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Continental_drift"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Continental_drift","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Continental_drift"}},"extract":"Continental drift is the hypothesis that the Earth's continents have moved over geologic time relative to each other, thus appearing to have \"drifted\" across the ocean bed.
