Usually, such a race consists of \"ordinary\" stages, but sometimes stages are held as an individual time trial or a team time trial. Long races such as the Tour de France, Absa Cape Epic or the Giro d'Italia are known for their stages of one day each, whereas the boat sailing Velux 5 Oceans Race is broken down in usually four stages of several weeks duration each, where the competitors are racing continuously day and night. In bicycling and running events, a race with stages is known as a stage race.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Race stage"},{"type":"standard","title":"Milan","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Milan</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q490","titles":{"canonical":"Milan","normalized":"Milan","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Milan</span>"},"pageid":36511,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Milan_skyline_skyscrapers_of_Porta_Nuova_business_district_%28cropped%29.jpg/320px-Milan_skyline_skyscrapers_of_Porta_Nuova_business_district_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":320,"height":150},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Milan_skyline_skyscrapers_of_Porta_Nuova_business_district_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":4896,"height":2296},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1223582236","tid":"cf5d19e3-10d0-11ef-bc4d-24dbe6693804","timestamp":"2024-05-13T02:30:49Z","description":"Second-largest city in Italy","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":45.46694444,"lon":9.19},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Milan"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Milan","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Milan"}},"extract":"Milan is a city in northern Italy, regional capital of Lombardy, and the second-most-populous city proper in Italy after Rome.
