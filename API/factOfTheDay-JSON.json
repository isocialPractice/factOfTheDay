It exacerbated an already existing agricultural recession.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Dust Bowl"},{"type":"standard","title":"Black_Sunday_(storm)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Black Sunday (storm)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q4921953","titles":{"canonical":"Black_Sunday_(storm)","normalized":"Black Sunday (storm)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Black Sunday (storm)</span>"},"pageid":20785764,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Dust_storm_in_Spearman%2CTexas%2C_Wea01422.jpg/330px-Dust_storm_in_Spearman%2CTexas%2C_Wea01422.jpg","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Dust_storm_in_Spearman%2CTexas%2C_Wea01422.jpg","width":700,"height":525},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1285500447","tid":"78f6fb73-18d6-11f0-9b3d-2b7838af2260","timestamp":"2025-04-14T02:16:28Z","description":"1935 dust storm in Oklahoma","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sunday_(storm)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sunday_(storm)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sunday_(storm)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Black_Sunday_(storm)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sunday_(storm)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Black_Sunday_(storm)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sunday_(storm)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Black_Sunday_(storm)"}},"extract":"Black Sunday was a particularly severe dust storm that occurred on April 14, 1935, as part of the Dust Bowl in the United States.
