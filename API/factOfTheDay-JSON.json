However, Edward pursued his quarry off the battlefield and left Henry's men exposed. Henry was forced to launch an infantry attack up Offham Hill where he was defeated by the barons' men defending the summit. The royalists fled back to the castle and priory and the King was forced to sign the Mise of Lewes, ceding many of his powers to de Montfort.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Battle of Lewes"},{"type":"standard","title":"Mise_of_Lewes","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mise of Lewes</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q6875314","titles":{"canonical":"Mise_of_Lewes","normalized":"Mise of Lewes","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mise of Lewes</span>"},"pageid":24068963,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/LewesBattle_Big.jpg/330px-LewesBattle_Big.jpg","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/LewesBattle_Big.jpg","width":1136,"height":852},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1252086813","tid":"c03091cc-8e47-11ef-a8ef-d579120a92d6","timestamp":"2024-10-19T18:27:09Z","description":"1264 English settlement of the Second Barons' War","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_of_Lewes","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_of_Lewes?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_of_Lewes?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mise_of_Lewes"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_of_Lewes","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Mise_of_Lewes","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_of_Lewes?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mise_of_Lewes"}},"extract":"The Mise[a] of Lewes was a settlement made on 14 May 1264 between King Henry III of England and his rebellious barons, led by Simon de Montfort.
