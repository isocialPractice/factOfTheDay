Originally including seven articles, the Constitution delineates the national frame and constrains the powers of the federal government. The Constitution's first three articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers, in which the federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative, consisting of the bicameral Congress ; the executive, consisting of the president and subordinate officers ; and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts. Article IV, Article V, and Article VI embody concepts of federalism, describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments, the states in relationship to the federal government, and the shared process of constitutional amendment. Article VII establishes the procedure subsequently used by the 13 states to ratify it. The Constitution of the United States is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force in the world.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Constitution of the United States"},{"type":"standard","title":"Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Federal judiciary of the United States</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q194907","titles":{"canonical":"Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States","normalized":"Federal judiciary of the United States","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Federal judiciary of the United States</span>"},"pageid":1636627,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1202893376","tid":"3dd5d3f0-c2ca-11ee-8d68-5f3d001f7e8d","timestamp":"2024-02-03T19:27:13Z","description":"Third constitutional branch of government","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States"}},"extract":"The federal judiciary of the United States is one of the three branches of the federal government of the United States organized under the United States Constitution and laws of the federal government.
