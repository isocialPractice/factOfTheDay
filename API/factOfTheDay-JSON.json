It has been described as one of the most horrific frontier massacres of the war. A mixed force of Loyalists, British soldiers, Senecas, and Mohawks descended on Cherry Valley, whose defenders, despite warnings, were unprepared for the attack. During the raid, the Seneca in particular targeted non-combatants, and reports state that 30 such individuals were killed, in addition to a number of armed defenders.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Cherry Valley massacre"},{"type":"standard","title":"Cherry_Valley_(village),_New_York","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Cherry Valley (village), New York</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2885420","titles":{"canonical":"Cherry_Valley_(village),_New_York","normalized":"Cherry Valley (village), New York","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Cherry Valley (village), New York</span>"},"pageid":259984,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1314487278","tid":"51c8bb29-9eee-11f0-8cb2-289a496aaa32","timestamp":"2025-10-01T17:44:46Z","description":"Village in Otsego County, New York, United States","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":42.79694444,"lon":-74.75416667},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Valley_(village)%2C_New_York","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Valley_(village)%2C_New_York?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Valley_(village)%2C_New_York?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cherry_Valley_(village)%2C_New_York"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Valley_(village)%2C_New_York","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Cherry_Valley_(village)%2C_New_York","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Valley_(village)%2C_New_York?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cherry_Valley_(village)%2C_New_York"}},"extract":"Cherry Valley is a village in Otsego County, New York, United States.
