By the time of Domesday Book, completed in 1086, St Mary's was serving as a parish church.</p>","normalizedtitle":"St Mary's Church, Reculver"},{"type":"standard","title":"Reculver","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Reculver</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3307700","titles":{"canonical":"Reculver","normalized":"Reculver","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Reculver</span>"},"pageid":793579,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Western_Face_of_St_Mary%27s_Church%2C_Reculver_%28I%29.jpg/320px-Western_Face_of_St_Mary%27s_Church%2C_Reculver_%28I%29.jpg","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Western_Face_of_St_Mary%27s_Church%2C_Reculver_%28I%29.jpg","width":4391,"height":3290},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1265219721","tid":"f41fbbcb-c2fd-11ef-bb0f-9cf5acf6aece","timestamp":"2024-12-25T20:22:25Z","description":"Seaside village in Kent, England","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":51.3786,"lon":1.1979},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reculver","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reculver?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reculver?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Reculver"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reculver","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Reculver","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reculver?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Reculver"}},"extract":"Reculver is a village and coastal resort about 3 miles (5 km) east of Herne Bay on the north coast of Kent in south-east England.\nIt is in the ward of the same name, in the City of Canterbury district of Kent.","extract_html":"<p><b>Reculver</b> is a village and coastal resort about 3 miles (5 km) east of Herne Bay on the north coast of Kent in south-east England.\nIt is in the ward of the same name, in the City of Canterbury district of Kent.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Reculver"},{"type":"standard","title":"Coastal_erosion","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Coastal erosion</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1542312","titles":{"canonical":"Coastal_erosion","normalized":"Coastal erosion","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Coastal erosion</span>"},"pageid":149261,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Coastal_Erosion_Hunstanton_Cliffs.jpg/320px-Coastal_Erosion_Hunstanton_Cliffs.jpg","width":320,"height":480},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Coastal_Erosion_Hunstanton_Cliffs.jpg","width":768,"height":1152},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1265510034","tid":"d6e6fd26-c427-11ef-98c9-286f8072f744","timestamp":"2024-12-27T07:54:46Z","description":"Displacement of land along the coastline","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_erosion","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_erosion?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_erosion?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Coastal_erosion"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_erosion","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Coastal_erosion","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_erosion?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Coastal_erosion"}},"extract":"Coastal erosion is the loss or displacement of land, or the long-term removal of sediment and rocks along the coastline due to the action of waves, currents, tides, wind-driven water, waterborne ice, or other impacts of storms.
