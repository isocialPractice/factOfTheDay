Her body was found in the house's basement about seven hours after she had been reported missing. She had sustained a broken skull, and a garrote was tied around her neck. The autopsy report stated that JonBenét's official cause of death was \"asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma\". Her death was ruled a homicide. The case generated worldwide public and media interest, in part because her mother Patsy Ramsey, a former beauty queen, had entered JonBenét into a series of child beauty pageants.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Killing of JonBenét Ramsey"},{"type":"standard","title":"Boulder,_Colorado","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Boulder, Colorado</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q192517","titles":{"canonical":"Boulder,_Colorado","normalized":"Boulder, Colorado","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Boulder, Colorado</span>"},"pageid":94341,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Pearl_Street_Mall.jpg/320px-Pearl_Street_Mall.jpg","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Pearl_Street_Mall.jpg","width":1024,"height":768},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1265109802","tid":"68632dcb-c277-11ef-bce9-66377aa1ecf9","timestamp":"2024-12-25T04:19:18Z","description":"City in Colorado, United States","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":40.015,"lon":-105.27055556},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder%2C_Colorado","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder%2C_Colorado?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder%2C_Colorado?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boulder%2C_Colorado"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder%2C_Colorado","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Boulder%2C_Colorado","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder%2C_Colorado?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boulder%2C_Colorado"}},"extract":"Boulder is a home rule city in and the county seat of Boulder County, Colorado, United States.
