As a result, it was decided to attack the garrison along the Elands River in an effort to capture the supplies located there.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Battle of Elands River (1900)"}],"year":1900},{"text":"A group including George Carmack and Skookum Jim Mason (pictured) discovered gold  near Dawson City, Canada, setting off the Klondike Gold Rush.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"George_Carmack","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">George Carmack</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q720659","titles":{"canonical":"George_Carmack","normalized":"George Carmack","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">George Carmack</span>"},"pageid":4253607,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/George_Carmack_-_01.jpg/320px-George_Carmack_-_01.jpg","width":320,"height":538},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/George_Carmack_-_01.jpg","width":462,"height":777},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1170706846","tid":"12cd51f8-3c61-11ee-bdf5-3f3f91203e78","timestamp":"2023-08-16T18:16:52Z","description":"Prospector who discovered gold which led to the Klondike Gold Rush","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carmack","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carmack?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carmack?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:George_Carmack"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carmack","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/George_Carmack","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carmack?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:George_Carmack"}},"extract":"George Washington Carmack was an American prospector in the Yukon.
