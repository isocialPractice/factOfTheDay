After a rule of ten months, the barbarian general Odoacer defeated and killed Orestes and deposed Romulus. As Odoacer did not proclaim any successor, Romulus is typically regarded as the last Western Roman emperor, his deposition marking the end of the Western Roman Empire as a political entity. The deposition of Romulus Augustulus is also sometimes used by historians to mark the transition from antiquity to the medieval period.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Romulus Augustulus"},{"type":"standard","title":"Western_Roman_Empire","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Western Roman Empire</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q42834","titles":{"canonical":"Western_Roman_Empire","normalized":"Western Roman Empire","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Western Roman Empire</span>"},"pageid":504379,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Western_Roman_Empire_-_400_AD.png/320px-Western_Roman_Empire_-_400_AD.png","width":320,"height":226},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Western_Roman_Empire_-_400_AD.png","width":7000,"height":4949},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1252893541","tid":"5bba45c5-9135-11ef-ba83-775c6b91fc84","timestamp":"2024-10-23T11:53:03Z","description":"Western half of the Roman Empire","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Western_Roman_Empire"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Western_Roman_Empire","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Western_Roman_Empire"}},"extract":"In modern historiography, the Western Roman Empire was the western provinces of the Roman Empire, collectively, during any period in which they were administered separately from the eastern provinces by a separate, independent imperial court.
