In addition, three summer and two winter editions of the games were scheduled to take place but were later cancelled due to war: Berlin (summer) in 1916; Sapporo–Garmisch-Partenkirchen (winter) and Tokyo–Helsinki (summer) in 1940; and Cortina d'Ampezzo (winter) and London (summer) in 1944. The 1906 Intercalated Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens. However, in 1949, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games. The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were postponed for the first time in the Olympics history to summer 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the 2022 Winter Olympics being held roughly six months later in Beijing.</p>","normalizedtitle":"List of Olympic Games host cities"},{"views":127743,"rank":36,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-07-31Z","views":184},{"date":"2024-08-01Z","views":304},{"date":"2024-08-02Z","views":4037},{"date":"2024-08-03Z","views":2378},{"date":"2024-08-04Z","views":127743}],"type":"standard","title":"Ethan_Katzberg","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ethan Katzberg</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q113575646","titles":{"canonical":"Ethan_Katzberg","normalized":"Ethan Katzberg","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Ethan Katzberg</span>"},"pageid":71573315,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/WKB2023_2665_hammer_%2853173532020%29.jpg/320px-WKB2023_2665_hammer_%2853173532020%29.jpg","width":320,"height":250},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/WKB2023_2665_hammer_%2853173532020%29.jpg","width":2947,"height":2298},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1238667547","tid":"f2623d96-52cf-11ef-ba8e-dcb98614060f","timestamp":"2024-08-05T02:10:55Z","description":"Canadian hammer thrower (born 2002)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Katzberg","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Katzberg?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Katzberg?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ethan_Katzberg"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Katzberg","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Ethan_Katzberg","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Katzberg?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ethan_Katzberg"}},"extract":"Ethan Katzberg is a Canadian hammer thrower.
