It was also the sixth and most recent presidential election in U.S. history in which both major party candidates were registered in the same home state; the others have been in 1860, 1904, 1920, 1940, and 1944.</p>","normalizedtitle":"2016 United States presidential election"},{"views":191835,"rank":12,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-11-05Z","views":119854},{"date":"2024-11-06Z","views":1022629},{"date":"2024-11-07Z","views":494390},{"date":"2024-11-08Z","views":273452},{"date":"2024-11-09Z","views":191835}],"type":"standard","title":"JD_Vance","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">JD Vance</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q28935729","titles":{"canonical":"JD_Vance","normalized":"JD Vance","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">JD Vance</span>"},"pageid":53396477,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Senator_Vance_official_portrait._118th_Congress.jpg/320px-Senator_Vance_official_portrait._118th_Congress.jpg","width":320,"height":400},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Senator_Vance_official_portrait._118th_Congress.jpg","width":6201,"height":7752},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1256495353","tid":"2aa77b74-9f25-11ef-a76e-63ecbb114703","timestamp":"2024-11-10T05:32:25Z","description":"Vice President-elect of the United States","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD_Vance","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD_Vance?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD_Vance?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:JD_Vance"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD_Vance","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/JD_Vance","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD_Vance?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:JD_Vance"}},"extract":"James David Vance is an American politician, author, and former United States Marine who is the vice president-elect of the United States.
