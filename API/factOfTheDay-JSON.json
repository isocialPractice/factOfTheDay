It is the oldest existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise in North America, and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) considers it to be one of the \"most important championships available to the sport\". The trophy was commissioned in 1892 as the <b>Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup</b> and is named after Lord Stanley of Preston, the governor general of Canada, who donated it as an award to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. The entire Stanley family supported the sport, the sons and daughters all playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to the Montreal Hockey Club, and winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), the two main professional ice hockey organizations, reached an agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. It was established as the <i>de facto</i> championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the <i>de jure</i> NHL championship prize in 1947.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Stanley Cup"},{"type":"standard","title":"Dawson_City_Nuggets","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Dawson City Nuggets</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3346094","titles":{"canonical":"Dawson_City_Nuggets","normalized":"Dawson City Nuggets","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Dawson City Nuggets</span>"},"pageid":3204101,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Dawson_City_Nuggets.png/330px-Dawson_City_Nuggets.png","width":320,"height":282},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Dawson_City_Nuggets.png","width":630,"height":556},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1295908451","tid":"0965c8a6-4aca-11f0-82de-c9e4f44d18fd","timestamp":"2025-06-16T15:53:25Z","description":"Historic ice hockey team in Yukon, Canada","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson_City_Nuggets","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson_City_Nuggets?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson_City_Nuggets?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dawson_City_Nuggets"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson_City_Nuggets","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Dawson_City_Nuggets","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson_City_Nuggets?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dawson_City_Nuggets"}},"extract":"The Dawson City Nuggets were an ice hockey team from Dawson City, Yukon, that challenged the reigning champion Ottawa Hockey Club, aka \"the Silver Seven\", in January 1905, for the Stanley Cup.

The feminine form <i>Augusta</i> was used for Roman empresses and other female members of the imperial family. The masculine and feminine forms originated in the time of the Roman Republic, in connection with things considered divine or sacred in traditional Roman religion. Their use as titles for major and minor Roman deities of the Empire associated the imperial system and family with traditional Roman virtues and the divine will and may be considered a feature of the Roman imperial cult.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Augustus (title)"},{"type":"standard","title":"Princeps","displaytitle":"<i>Princeps</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q396808","titles":{"canonical":"Princeps","normalized":"Princeps","display":"<i>Princeps</i>"},"pageid":263328,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1332409310","tid":"e00604ae-ef1f-11f0-87f7-49116ff8e30b","timestamp":"2026-01-11T19:01:03Z","description":"Ancient Roman title","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeps","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeps?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeps?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Princeps"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeps","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Princeps","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeps?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Princeps"}},"extract":"Princeps is a Latin word meaning \"first in time or order; the first, foremost, chief, the most eminent, distinguished, or noble; the first person\".
