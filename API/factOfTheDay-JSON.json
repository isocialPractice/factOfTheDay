Each year, at the conclusion of the final game of the Stanley Cup Finals, members of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association vote to elect the player deserving of the trophy. The trophy is handed out by the NHL Commissioner before the presentation of the Stanley Cup and only the winner is announced, in contrast to most of the other NHL awards which name three finalists and are presented at a ceremony. Vote tallies for the Conn Smythe Trophy were released starting in 2017.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Conn Smythe Trophy"},{"views":86351,"rank":32,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-06-21Z","views":99584},{"date":"2024-06-22Z","views":161656},{"date":"2024-06-23Z","views":192333},{"date":"2024-06-24Z","views":117762},{"date":"2024-06-25Z","views":86351}],"type":"standard","title":"Inside_Out_2","displaytitle":"<i>Inside Out 2</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q113877606","titles":{"canonical":"Inside_Out_2","normalized":"Inside Out 2","display":"<i>Inside Out 2</i>"},"pageid":71720228,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f7/Inside_Out_2_poster.jpg","width":260,"height":385},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f7/Inside_Out_2_poster.jpg","width":260,"height":385},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1231046412","tid":"ecdf1708-3375-11ef-bef5-fa7f500b8180","timestamp":"2024-06-26T04:38:25Z","description":"2024 Pixar film","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_2","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_2?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_2?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Inside_Out_2"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_2","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Inside_Out_2","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_2?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Inside_Out_2"}},"extract":"Inside Out 2 is a 2024 American animated coming-of-age film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures.
