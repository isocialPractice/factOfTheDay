It was led by the United States in collaboration with the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was directed by Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the bombs. The Army program was designated the <b>Manhattan District</b>, as its first headquarters were in Manhattan; the name gradually superseded the official codename, <b>Development of Substitute Materials</b>, for the entire project. The project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, Tube Alloys. The Manhattan Project employed nearly 130,000 people at its peak and cost nearly US$2 billion, over 80 percent of which was for building and operating the plants that produced the fissile material. Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the US, the UK, and Canada.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Manhattan Project"}],"year":1939},{"text":"At the California Institute of Technology, American physicist Carl David Anderson proved the existence of antimatter with the discovery of the positron, for which he would receive the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"California_Institute_of_Technology","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">California Institute of Technology</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q161562","titles":{"canonical":"California_Institute_of_Technology","normalized":"California Institute of Technology","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">California Institute of Technology</span>"},"pageid":5786,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Seal_of_the_California_Institute_of_Technology.svg/320px-Seal_of_the_California_Institute_of_Technology.svg.png","width":320,"height":319},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Seal_of_the_California_Institute_of_Technology.svg/250px-Seal_of_the_California_Institute_of_Technology.svg.png","width":250,"height":249},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1237038838","tid":"61e57423-4c59-11ef-b97e-e59c45bd8442","timestamp":"2024-07-27T20:47:05Z","description":"Research university in California, US","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":34.1375,"lon":-118.125},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:California_Institute_of_Technology"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/California_Institute_of_Technology","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:California_Institute_of_Technology"}},"extract":"The California Institute of Technology (branded as Caltech) is a private research university in Pasadena, California.

Often when a given Roman is described as becoming <i>emperor</i> in English, it reflects his taking of the title <i>augustus</i> and later <i>basileus</i>. Another title used was <i>imperator</i>, originally a military honorific, and <i>caesar</i>, originally a surname. Early emperors also used the title <i>princeps</i> alongside other Republican titles, notably <i>consul</i> and <i>pontifex maximus</i>.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Roman emperor"},{"type":"standard","title":"Majorian","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Majorian</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q191956","titles":{"canonical":"Majorian","normalized":"Majorian","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Majorian</span>"},"pageid":75155,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Solidus_Majorian_Arles_%28obverse%29.jpg/320px-Solidus_Majorian_Arles_%28obverse%29.jpg","width":320,"height":307},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Solidus_Majorian_Arles_%28obverse%29.jpg","width":338,"height":324},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1238076758","tid":"aa8baefc-5064-11ef-a216-4d70f125ddae","timestamp":"2024-08-02T00:17:56Z","description":"Western Roman emperor from 457 to 461","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorian","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorian?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorian?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Majorian"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorian","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Majorian","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorian?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Majorian"}},"extract":"Majorian was the Western Roman emperor from 457 to 461.
