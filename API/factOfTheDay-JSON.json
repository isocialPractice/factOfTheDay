Chongqing is one of the four direct-administered municipalities under the Central People's Government, along with Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin. It is the only directly administrated municipality located deep inland. The municipality covers a large geographical area roughly the size of Austria, which includes several disjunct urban areas in addition to Chongqing proper. Due to its classification, the municipality of Chongqing is the largest city proper in the world by population, though Chongqing is not the most populous urban area.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Chongqing"},{"type":"standard","title":"Bombing_of_Chongqing","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Bombing of Chongqing</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q705165","titles":{"canonical":"Bombing_of_Chongqing","normalized":"Bombing of Chongqing","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Bombing of Chongqing</span>"},"pageid":1917623,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/ChongqingBombing.jpg","width":240,"height":165},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/ChongqingBombing.jpg","width":240,"height":165},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1290494741","tid":"ae942683-3143-11f0-8c64-f3ac965f1fe0","timestamp":"2025-05-15T04:18:41Z","description":"1938–1944 Japanese air raids against Chongqing, China","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":29.4814,"lon":106.9382},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Chongqing","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Chongqing?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Chongqing?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bombing_of_Chongqing"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Chongqing","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Bombing_of_Chongqing","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Chongqing?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bombing_of_Chongqing"}},"extract":"The bombing of Chongqing, from 18 February 1938 to 19 December 1944, was a series of massive terror bombing operations authorized by the Empire of Japan's Imperial General Headquarters and conducted by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (IJAAF) and Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAF).
