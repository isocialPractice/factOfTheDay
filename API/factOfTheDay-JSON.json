Constantius went on to lead campaigns against various barbarian groups in Hispania and Gaul, recovering much of both for the Western Roman Empire. He married Honorius's sister Galla Placidia in 417, a sign of his ascendant status, and was proclaimed co-emperor by Honorius on 8 February 421. Constantius reigned for seven months before dying on 2 September 421.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Constantius III"},{"type":"standard","title":"Western_Roman_Empire","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Western Roman Empire</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q42834","titles":{"canonical":"Western_Roman_Empire","normalized":"Western Roman Empire","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Western Roman Empire</span>"},"pageid":504379,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Mapa_Imperio_Occidental_a%C3%B1o_418.svg/320px-Mapa_Imperio_Occidental_a%C3%B1o_418.svg.png","width":320,"height":324},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Mapa_Imperio_Occidental_a%C3%B1o_418.svg/1220px-Mapa_Imperio_Occidental_a%C3%B1o_418.svg.png","width":1220,"height":1235},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1272657312","tid":"2e86e9ed-de72-11ef-84a2-7563fde2ef2d","timestamp":"2025-01-29T18:52:26Z","description":"Western half of the Roman Empire","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Western_Roman_Empire"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Western_Roman_Empire","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Western_Roman_Empire"}},"extract":"In modern historiography, the Western Roman Empire was the western provinces of the Roman Empire, collectively, during any period in which they were administered separately from the eastern provinces by a separate, independent imperial court.
