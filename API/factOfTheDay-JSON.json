He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy, which was formed from Lee's experiences in unarmed fighting and self-defense—as well as eclectic, Zen Buddhist and Taoist philosophies—as a new school of martial arts thought. With a film career spanning Hong Kong and the United States, Lee is regarded as the first global Chinese film star and one of the most influential martial artists in the history of cinema. Known for his roles in five feature-length martial arts films, Lee is credited with helping to popularize martial arts films in the 1970s and promoting Hong Kong action cinema.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Bruce Lee"},{"views":114855,"rank":22,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-12-15Z","views":13981},{"date":"2025-12-16Z","views":17931},{"date":"2025-12-17Z","views":81080},{"date":"2025-12-18Z","views":129138},{"date":"2025-12-19Z","views":114855}],"type":"standard","title":"Odessa_A'zion","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Odessa A&#039;zion</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q55346754","titles":{"canonical":"Odessa_A'zion","normalized":"Odessa A'zion","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Odessa A&#039;zion</span>"},"pageid":65518526,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Odessa_A%27zion_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/330px-Odessa_A%27zion_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg","width":320,"height":400},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Odessa_A%27zion_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg","width":1824,"height":2280},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1328458424","tid":"a552e4b5-dd3a-11f0-adcf-b99a253e5467","timestamp":"2025-12-20T00:27:20Z","description":"American and German actress (born 2000)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_A'zion","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_A'zion?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_A'zion?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Odessa_A'zion"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_A'zion","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Odessa_A'zion","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_A'zion?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Odessa_A'zion"}},"extract":"Odessa Zion Segall Adlon, often known as Odessa A'zion, is an American actress.
