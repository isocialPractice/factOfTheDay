It is the world's seventh-largest military measured by active military personnel and consists of three uniformed services—the Army, Navy, and the Air Force, which are backed by several paramilitary forces such as the National Guard and the Civil Armed Forces. As of the 2025 reforms, the highest-ranking military officer is the Chief of Defence Forces (CDF), who also serves concurrently as Chief of Army Staff (COAS), holding principal command authority over all three branches and overseeing war strategy, operations, joint force development, and resource allocation. The office of Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) has been abolished, and many prior responsibilities are now assumed by the CDF, streamlining military command and accelerating decision-making.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Pakistan Armed Forces"},{"type":"standard","title":"Balochistan,_Pakistan","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Balochistan, Pakistan</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q163239","titles":{"canonical":"Balochistan,_Pakistan","normalized":"Balochistan, Pakistan","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Balochistan, Pakistan</span>"},"pageid":4687,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Quaid-e-Azam_Residancy_Ziarat_Balochistan_by_Balochlens.jpg/330px-Quaid-e-Azam_Residancy_Ziarat_Balochistan_by_Balochlens.jpg","width":330,"height":219},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Quaid-e-Azam_Residancy_Ziarat_Balochistan_by_Balochlens.jpg","width":3008,"height":2000},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1336658372","tid":"256ed3eb-022d-11f1-a060-192a9247a500","timestamp":"2026-02-05T00:53:55Z","description":"Province of Pakistan","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":27.7,"lon":65.7},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan%2C_Pakistan","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan%2C_Pakistan?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan%2C_Pakistan?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Balochistan%2C_Pakistan"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan%2C_Pakistan","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Balochistan%2C_Pakistan","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan%2C_Pakistan?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Balochistan%2C_Pakistan"}},"extract":"Balochistan is a province of Pakistan.

Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber Valley. Vatican City is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city. Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geography, and also as the \"Eternal City\". Rome is generally considered to be one of the cradles of Western civilization and Western Christian culture, and the centre of the Catholic Church.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Rome"},{"type":"standard","title":"Third_Punic_War","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Third Punic War</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q6334","titles":{"canonical":"Third_Punic_War","normalized":"Third Punic War","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Third Punic War</span>"},"pageid":57551,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/City_of_Carthage_circa_149_BC.png/330px-City_of_Carthage_circa_149_BC.png","width":330,"height":264},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/City_of_Carthage_circa_149_BC.png","width":1371,"height":1096},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1336450070","tid":"16165ce3-0149-11f1-b7d9-e8bc10c0de33","timestamp":"2026-02-03T21:41:24Z","description":"War between Rome and Carthage (149–146 BC)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Punic_War","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Punic_War?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Punic_War?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Third_Punic_War"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Punic_War","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Third_Punic_War","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Punic_War?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Third_Punic_War"}},"extract":"The Third Punic War was the third and last of the Punic Wars fought between Carthage and Rome.

It was Monteverdi's last opera, with a libretto by Giovanni Francesco Busenello, and was first performed at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice during the 1643 carnival season. The opera was revived in Naples in 1651, but was then neglected until the rediscovery of the score in 1888, after which it became the subject of scholarly attention in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1960s, the opera has been performed and recorded many times.</p>","normalizedtitle":"L'incoronazione di Poppea"}],"year":1913},{"text":"Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland announced his invention of Bakelite (production device pictured), the world's first synthetic plastic.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Leo_Baekeland","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Leo Baekeland</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q243442","titles":{"canonical":"Leo_Baekeland","normalized":"Leo Baekeland","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Leo Baekeland</span>"},"pageid":256703,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Leo_Baekeland_ca_1906.jpg/330px-Leo_Baekeland_ca_1906.jpg","width":330,"height":408},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Leo_Baekeland_ca_1906.jpg","width":2049,"height":2531},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1306412470","tid":"2891dc8f-7b85-11f0-9eff-957c6e56b51a","timestamp":"2025-08-17T16:13:49Z","description":"Belgian chemist (1863–1944); inventor of Bakelite","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Baekeland","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Baekeland?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Baekeland?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Leo_Baekeland"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Baekeland","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Leo_Baekeland","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Baekeland?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Leo_Baekeland"}},"extract":"Leo Hendrik Baekeland was a Belgian chemist.
