Born in Queens, a borough of New York City, Jackson began pursuing a musical career in 1996. In 1999–2000, he recorded his debut album, <i>Power of the Dollar</i>, for Columbia Records. During a shooting in May 2000, he was struck by nine bullets, causing its release to be canceled and Jackson to be dropped from the label. His 2002 mixtape <i>Guess Who's Back?</i> was discovered by Detroit rapper Eminem, who signed Jackson to his label Shady Records that year.</p>","normalizedtitle":"50 Cent"}]},"image":{"title":"File:Санкт-Петербург, Чкаловский 46, барельеф.jpg","thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%82-%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B3%2C_%D0%A7%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_46%2C_%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D1%84.jpg/960px-%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%82-%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B3%2C_%D0%A7%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_46%2C_%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D1%84.jpg","width":640,"height":360},"image":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%82-%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B3%2C_%D0%A7%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_46%2C_%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D1%84.jpg","width":5095,"height":2866},"file_page":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%82-%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B3,_%D0%A7%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_46,_%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D1%84.jpg","artist":{"html":"<bdi><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q99741741\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"d:Q99741741\"><span title=\"Wikimedian\">Nikolai Bulykin</span></a></bdi>","text":"Nikolai Bulykin"},"credit":{"html":"<span class=\"int-own-work\" lang=\"en\">Own work</span> <span class=\"mw-valign-text-top\" typeof=\"mw:File/Frameless\"><a href=\"//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%82-%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B3,_%D0%A7%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_46,_%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D1%84.jpg#P7482\" title=\"Edit this at Structured Data on Commons\"><img alt=\"Edit this at Structured Data on Commons\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\" class=\"mw-file-element\" data-file-width=\"20\" data-file-height=\"20\"></a></span>","text":"Own work"},"license":{"type":"Public domain","code":"pd"},"description":{"html":"\"Unity of humanitarian and technical sciences\", <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink/Interwiki\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%20Union\" title=\"en:Soviet Union\" class=\"extiw\">Soviet</a> time <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink/Interwiki\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief#Bas-relief_or_low_relief\" title=\"en:Relief\" class=\"extiw\">Bas-relief</a> in <a rel=\"mw:WikiLink/Interwiki\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint%20Petersburg\" title=\"en:Saint Petersburg\" class=\"extiw\">Saint Petersburg</a>","text":"\"Unity of humanitarian and technical sciences\", Soviet time Bas-relief in Saint Petersburg","lang":"en"},"wb_entity_id":"M122947584","structured":{"captions":{"ru":"Барельеф \"Единство гуманитарных и технических наук\".
