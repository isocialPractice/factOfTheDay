The Republican ticket of businessman Donald Trump and Indiana governor Mike Pence defeated the Democratic ticket of former secretary of state and First Lady of the United States Hillary Clinton and Virginia junior senator Tim Kaine, in what was considered one of the biggest political upsets in American history. It was the fifth and most recent presidential election in which the winning candidate lost the popular vote. It was also the sixth and most recent presidential election in U.S. history in which both major party candidates were registered in the same home state; the others have been in 1860, 1904, 1920, 1940, and 1944.</p>","normalizedtitle":"2016 United States presidential election"},{"views":67053,"rank":40,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-10-28Z","views":36484},{"date":"2024-10-29Z","views":48270},{"date":"2024-10-30Z","views":25960},{"date":"2024-10-31Z","views":26335},{"date":"2024-11-01Z","views":67053}],"type":"standard","title":"Crown_Jewel_(2024)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Crown Jewel (2024)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q126123514","titles":{"canonical":"Crown_Jewel_(2024)","normalized":"Crown Jewel (2024)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Crown Jewel (2024)</span>"},"pageid":77013031,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/aa/Crown_Jewel_%282024%29_poster.jpg","width":264,"height":385},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/aa/Crown_Jewel_%282024%29_poster.jpg","width":264,"height":385},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1254873213","tid":"6065bbd4-98c6-11ef-8566-af88ead54452","timestamp":"2024-11-02T02:58:46Z","description":"WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming event","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Jewel_(2024)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Jewel_(2024)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Jewel_(2024)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Crown_Jewel_(2024)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Jewel_(2024)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Crown_Jewel_(2024)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Jewel_(2024)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Crown_Jewel_(2024)"}},"extract":"The 2024 Crown Jewel is an upcoming professional wrestling event produced by the American company WWE.

Protests triggered by detention of Georgian politician Irakli Okruashvili on charges of extortion, money laundering, and abuse of office during his tenure as defense minister of the country were organized by the National Council, an ad hoc coalition of ten opposition parties, and financed by the media tycoon Badri Patarkatsishvili. Demonstrations occurred both in September and November 2007 and were initially largely peaceful. The protests went downhill by 6 November 2007, but turned violent the next day when the police, using heavy-handed tactics, including tear gas and water cannon, unblocked Rustaveli Avenue, Tbilisi's main boulevard, dislodged the protesters from the territory adjoining to the House of Parliament, and prevented the demonstrators from resuming the protests. The government accused the Russian secret services of being involved in an attempted coup d'état and declared a nationwide state of emergency later that day which lasted until 16 November 2007.</p>","normalizedtitle":"2007 Georgian demonstrations"},{"type":"standard","title":"Mikheil_Saakashvili","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mikheil Saakashvili</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q43330","titles":{"canonical":"Mikheil_Saakashvili","normalized":"Mikheil Saakashvili","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Mikheil Saakashvili</span>"},"pageid":376738,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Mikheil_Saakashvili%2C_2020.jpg/320px-Mikheil_Saakashvili%2C_2020.jpg","width":320,"height":345},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Mikheil_Saakashvili%2C_2020.jpg","width":366,"height":395},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1254659925","tid":"8ae55dae-97f0-11ef-9979-a2ed0fdd4712","timestamp":"2024-11-01T01:28:05Z","description":"Georgian-Ukrainian politician, former President of Georgia, former Governor of Odesa","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikheil_Saakashvili","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikheil_Saakashvili?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikheil_Saakashvili?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mikheil_Saakashvili"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikheil_Saakashvili","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Mikheil_Saakashvili","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikheil_Saakashvili?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mikheil_Saakashvili"}},"extract":"Mikheil Saakashvili is a Georgian and Ukrainian politician and jurist.
