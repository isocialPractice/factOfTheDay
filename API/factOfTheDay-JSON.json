Sinwar, who was one of Israel's most wanted men after the 7 October attack, was allegedly in a building with two others. The military operation was described as random and not planned in advance. The investigators who had interrogated Sinwar during his previous captivity as well as a dentist were called in to identify the body, which was transferred to Israel.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Killing of Yahya Sinwar"},{"views":71689,"rank":31,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-10-13Z","views":95146},{"date":"2024-10-14Z","views":93810},{"date":"2024-10-15Z","views":87405},{"date":"2024-10-16Z","views":74279},{"date":"2024-10-17Z","views":71689}],"type":"standard","title":"Sean_Combs","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Sean Combs</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q216936","titles":{"canonical":"Sean_Combs","normalized":"Sean Combs","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Sean Combs</span>"},"pageid":152447,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Sean_Combs_in_2023.png/320px-Sean_Combs_in_2023.png","width":320,"height":476},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Sean_Combs_in_2023.png","width":610,"height":908},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1251803667","tid":"2fa15490-8d0c-11ef-8b1f-e885e47454e4","timestamp":"2024-10-18T04:48:15Z","description":"American record executive and rapper (born 1969)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sean_Combs"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Sean_Combs","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sean_Combs"}},"extract":"Sean John Combs, also known by his stage name Diddy, formerly Puff Daddy and P.
