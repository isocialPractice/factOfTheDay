Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world. The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially the Old Faithful geyser, one of its most popular. While it represents many types of biomes, the subalpine forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Yellowstone National Park"},{"type":"standard","title":"Wyoming","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Wyoming</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1214","titles":{"canonical":"Wyoming","normalized":"Wyoming","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Wyoming</span>"},"pageid":33611,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Flag_of_Wyoming.svg/320px-Flag_of_Wyoming.svg.png","width":320,"height":224},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Flag_of_Wyoming.svg/1000px-Flag_of_Wyoming.svg.png","width":1000,"height":700},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1211056245","tid":"bf9e2890-d721-11ee-840a-3fdb33784ac2","timestamp":"2024-02-29T16:43:57Z","description":"U.S. state","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":43,"lon":-107},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wyoming"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Wyoming","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wyoming"}},"extract":"Wyoming is a state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States.
