The first of the kind, the Royal Navy's HMS Dreadnought, had such an effect when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built after her were referred to as \"dreadnoughts\", and earlier battleships became known as pre-dreadnoughts. Her design had two revolutionary features: an \"all-big-gun\" armament scheme, with an unprecedented number of heavy-calibre guns, and steam turbine propulsion. As dreadnoughts became a crucial symbol of national power, the arrival of these new warships renewed the naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany. Dreadnought races sprang up around the world, including in South America, lasting up to the beginning of World War I. Successive designs increased rapidly in size and made use of improvements in armament, armour, and propulsion throughout the dreadnought era. Within five years, new battleships outclassed Dreadnought herself. These more powerful vessels were known as \"super-dreadnoughts\".

The first of the kind, the Royal Navy's <span>HMS <i>Dreadnought</i></span>, had such an effect when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built after her were referred to as \"dreadnoughts\", and earlier battleships became known as pre-dreadnoughts. Her design had two revolutionary features: an \"all-big-gun\" armament scheme, with an unprecedented number of heavy-calibre guns, and steam turbine propulsion. As dreadnoughts became a crucial symbol of national power, the arrival of these new warships renewed the naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany. Dreadnought races sprang up around the world, including in South America, lasting up to the beginning of World War I.
