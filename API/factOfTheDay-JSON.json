Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i>, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the \"Dance of the Dragons.\"</p>","normalizedtitle":"House of the Dragon"},{"views":146588,"rank":13,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-07-05Z","views":22184},{"date":"2024-07-06Z","views":9764},{"date":"2024-07-07Z","views":5303},{"date":"2024-07-08Z","views":3447},{"date":"2024-07-09Z","views":146588}],"type":"standard","title":"Equatorial_Guinea","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Equatorial Guinea</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q983","titles":{"canonical":"Equatorial_Guinea","normalized":"Equatorial Guinea","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Equatorial Guinea</span>"},"pageid":9366,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Flag_of_Equatorial_Guinea.svg/320px-Flag_of_Equatorial_Guinea.svg.png","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Flag_of_Equatorial_Guinea.svg/1200px-Flag_of_Equatorial_Guinea.svg.png","width":1200,"height":800},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1232858600","tid":"e3e7ed7c-3b2c-11ef-9bcc-420fb408805a","timestamp":"2024-07-06T00:15:46Z","description":"Country in Central Africa","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":1.5,"lon":10},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_Guinea","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_Guinea?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_Guinea?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Equatorial_Guinea"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_Guinea","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Equatorial_Guinea","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_Guinea?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Equatorial_Guinea"}},"extract":"Equatorial Guinea, officially the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, is a country on the west coast of Central Africa, with an area of 28,000 square kilometres (11,000 sq mi).

It was the first major military campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise the battle's duration as being from 10 July until 31 October 1940, which overlaps the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, that lasted from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941. German historians do not follow this subdivision and regard the battle as a single campaign lasting from July 1940 to May 1941, including the Blitz.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Battle of Britain"},{"type":"standard","title":"Royal_Air_Force","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Royal Air Force</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q165862","titles":{"canonical":"Royal_Air_Force","normalized":"Royal Air Force","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Royal Air Force</span>"},"pageid":25679,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/RAF-Badge.svg/320px-RAF-Badge.svg.png","width":320,"height":302},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/RAF-Badge.svg/638px-RAF-Badge.svg.png","width":638,"height":603},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1233236165","tid":"cd749d23-3cc4-11ef-ac0d-27b47cca4075","timestamp":"2024-07-08T00:55:43Z","description":"Air and space warfare force of the United Kingdom","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Royal_Air_Force"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Royal_Air_Force","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Royal_Air_Force"}},"extract":"The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the air and space force of the United Kingdom, British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies.
