It began in Tunisia in response to the death of Mohamed Bouazizi by self-immolation. From Tunisia, the protests initially spread to five other countries: Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain. Rulers were deposed: Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, all in 2011; and Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen in 2012. Bashar al-Assad of Syria was deposed in December 2024 after 13 years of civil war. Major uprisings and social violence occurred, including riots, civil wars, or insurgencies. Sustained street demonstrations took place in Morocco, Iraq, Algeria, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman and Sudan.

His 1667 epic poem <i>Paradise Lost</i> was written in blank verse and included 12 books, written in a time of immense religious flux and political upheaval. It addressed the fall of man, including the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan, and God's expulsion of them from the Garden of Eden. <i>Paradise Lost</i> elevated Milton's reputation as one of history's greatest poets. He also served as a civil servant for the Commonwealth of England under its Council of State and later under Oliver Cromwell.</p>","normalizedtitle":"John Milton"},{"type":"standard","title":"Areopagitica","displaytitle":"<i>Areopagitica</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q642635","titles":{"canonical":"Areopagitica","normalized":"Areopagitica","display":"<i>Areopagitica</i>"},"pageid":256150,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Areopagitica_bridwell.jpg/330px-Areopagitica_bridwell.jpg","width":320,"height":450},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Areopagitica_bridwell.jpg","width":399,"height":561},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1315452816","tid":"3a704135-a2e9-11f0-b075-7467875a5e09","timestamp":"2025-10-06T19:18:24Z","description":"1644 prose polemic by John Milton","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagitica","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagitica?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagitica?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Areopagitica"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagitica","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Areopagitica","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagitica?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Areopagitica"}},"extract":"Areopagitica; A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, to the Parlament of England is a 1644 prose polemic by the English poet, scholar, and polemical author John Milton opposing licensing.
