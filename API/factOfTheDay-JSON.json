Constantius reigned for seven months before dying on 2 September 421.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Constantius III"},{"type":"standard","title":"Magister_militum","displaytitle":"<i>Magister militum</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q209122","titles":{"canonical":"Magister_militum","normalized":"Magister militum","display":"<i>Magister militum</i>"},"pageid":218713,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Rmn-mil-cmd-strct-4.png/330px-Rmn-mil-cmd-strct-4.png","width":320,"height":161},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Rmn-mil-cmd-strct-4.png","width":1000,"height":504},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1330475858","tid":"69d5e7ef-e66b-11f0-8a6a-c693c3462de0","timestamp":"2025-12-31T17:09:06Z","description":"Imperial Roman military office","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magister_militum","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magister_militum?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magister_militum?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Magister_militum"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magister_militum","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Magister_militum","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magister_militum?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Magister_militum"}},"extract":"Magister militum was a top-level military command used in the late Roman Empire, dating from the reign of Constantine the Great.
