In the Champions League era, the defending champions of the competition did not automatically qualify until the rules were changed in 2005 to allow title holders Liverpool to enter the competition.</p>","normalizedtitle":"List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League finals"},{"views":67840,"rank":42,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-05-05Z","views":5172},{"date":"2024-05-06Z","views":5718},{"date":"2024-05-07Z","views":61609},{"date":"2024-05-08Z","views":9897},{"date":"2024-05-09Z","views":67840}],"type":"standard","title":"Donte_DiVincenzo","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Donte DiVincenzo</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q51318989","titles":{"canonical":"Donte_DiVincenzo","normalized":"Donte DiVincenzo","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Donte DiVincenzo</span>"},"pageid":56992942,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Donte_DiVincenzo_%28White_House_visit%29.jpg/320px-Donte_DiVincenzo_%28White_House_visit%29.jpg","width":320,"height":447},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Donte_DiVincenzo_%28White_House_visit%29.jpg","width":625,"height":873},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1223000818","tid":"69716158-0dd5-11ef-a233-8e89fd382353","timestamp":"2024-05-09T07:26:12Z","description":"American basketball player (born 1997)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Donte_DiVincenzo"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Donte_DiVincenzo","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Donte_DiVincenzo"}},"extract":"Donte DiVincenzo is an American professional basketball player for the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
