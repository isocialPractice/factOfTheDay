Unlike gusts, the value of these winds are determined via their sampling and averaging the sampled results over a period of time. Wind measuring has been standardized globally to reflect the winds at 10 metres (33 ft) above mean sea level, and the maximum sustained wind represents the highest average wind over either a one-minute (US) or ten-minute time span, anywhere within the tropical cyclone. Surface winds are highly variable due to friction between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface, as well as near hills and mountains over land.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Maximum sustained wind"}],"year":2015},{"text":"Grand Theft Auto III was released, helping to popularize open-world and mature-content video games.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Grand_Theft_Auto_III","displaytitle":"<i>Grand Theft Auto III</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q149106","titles":{"canonical":"Grand_Theft_Auto_III","normalized":"Grand Theft Auto III","display":"<i>Grand Theft Auto III</i>"},"pageid":362641,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/GTA3boxcover.jpg","width":280,"height":362},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/GTA3boxcover.jpg","width":280,"height":362},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1252757799","tid":"5caba3fe-90b5-11ef-84cf-4179e8821d40","timestamp":"2024-10-22T20:36:49Z","description":"2001 video game","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Grand_Theft_Auto_III"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Grand_Theft_Auto_III","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Grand_Theft_Auto_III"}},"extract":"Grand Theft Auto III is a 2001 action-adventure game developed by DMA Design and published by Rockstar Games.

The stratosphere is composed of stratified temperature zones, with the warmer layers of air located higher and the cooler layers lower. The increase of temperature with altitude is a result of the absorption of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation by the ozone layer, where ozone is exothermically photolyzed into oxygen in a cyclical fashion. This temperature inversion is in contrast to the troposphere, where temperature decreases with altitude, and between the troposphere and stratosphere is the tropopause border that demarcates the beginning of the temperature inversion.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Stratosphere"}],"year":1934},{"text":"Alberto Santos-Dumont flew his biplane 14-bis for 50 metres (160 ft) at an altitude of about four metres (13 ft).","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Alberto_Santos-Dumont","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Alberto Santos-Dumont</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q313211","titles":{"canonical":"Alberto_Santos-Dumont","normalized":"Alberto Santos-Dumont","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Alberto Santos-Dumont</span>"},"pageid":152687,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Alberto_Santos-Dumont_portrait.jpg/320px-Alberto_Santos-Dumont_portrait.jpg","width":320,"height":420},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Alberto_Santos-Dumont_portrait.jpg","width":2412,"height":3164},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1251752884","tid":"d9b0cd12-8cd3-11ef-950e-e3704ef7f8a6","timestamp":"2024-10-17T22:04:59Z","description":"Brazilian aviation pioneer (1873–1932)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Santos-Dumont","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Santos-Dumont?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Santos-Dumont?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Alberto_Santos-Dumont"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Santos-Dumont","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Alberto_Santos-Dumont","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Santos-Dumont?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Alberto_Santos-Dumont"}},"extract":"Alberto Santos-Dumont, self-stylised as Alberto Santos=Dumont, was a Brazilian aeronaut, sportsman, inventor, and one of the few people to have contributed significantly to the early development of both lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air aircraft.
