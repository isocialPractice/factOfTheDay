The gold rush had severe effects on Native Californians and accelerated the Native American population's decline from disease, starvation, and the California genocide.</p>","normalizedtitle":"California gold rush"}],"year":1848},{"text":"The Estates unanimously proclaimed 14-year-old Matthias Corvinus King of Hungary after being persuaded to do so by his uncle Michael Szilágyi.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Estates_of_the_realm","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Estates of the realm</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q657326","titles":{"canonical":"Estates_of_the_realm","normalized":"Estates of the realm","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Estates of the realm</span>"},"pageid":393404,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Cleric-Knight-Workman.jpg/330px-Cleric-Knight-Workman.jpg","width":320,"height":316},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Cleric-Knight-Workman.jpg","width":1278,"height":1262},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1334200131","tid":"3c003002-f743-11f0-aea5-592013698248","timestamp":"2026-01-22T03:34:19Z","description":"Broad orders of social hierarchy","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Estates_of_the_realm"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Estates_of_the_realm","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Estates_of_the_realm"}},"extract":"The estates of the realm, or three estates, were the broad orders of social hierarchy used in Christendom from the Middle Ages to early modern Europe.
