Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i>, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the \"Dance of the Dragons.\"</p>","normalizedtitle":"House of the Dragon"},{"views":89877,"rank":33,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-07-07Z","views":893},{"date":"2024-07-08Z","views":739},{"date":"2024-07-09Z","views":798},{"date":"2024-07-10Z","views":250349},{"date":"2024-07-11Z","views":89877}],"type":"standard","title":"Disappearance_of_Andrew_Gosden","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Disappearance of Andrew Gosden</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q30636990","titles":{"canonical":"Disappearance_of_Andrew_Gosden","normalized":"Disappearance of Andrew Gosden","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Disappearance of Andrew Gosden</span>"},"pageid":53903049,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/Andrew_Gosden_Poster.jpg","width":264,"height":373},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/Andrew_Gosden_Poster.jpg","width":264,"height":373},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1234003536","tid":"dd59e8de-3ff4-11ef-a6c2-886e3abb24e7","timestamp":"2024-07-12T02:17:19Z","description":"2007 disappearance of 14-year-old in London","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Andrew_Gosden","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Andrew_Gosden?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Andrew_Gosden?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Disappearance_of_Andrew_Gosden"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Andrew_Gosden","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Disappearance_of_Andrew_Gosden","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Andrew_Gosden?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Disappearance_of_Andrew_Gosden"}},"extract":"Andrew Paul Gosden disappeared from Central London on 14 September 2007 when he was 14.
