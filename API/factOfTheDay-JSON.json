The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys. It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004. The word <i>Irmageddon</i> was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Hurricane Irma"},{"views":64719,"rank":40,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-10-04Z","views":3050},{"date":"2024-10-05Z","views":3892},{"date":"2024-10-06Z","views":7014},{"date":"2024-10-07Z","views":34507},{"date":"2024-10-08Z","views":64719}],"type":"standard","title":"Hurricane_Andrew","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Hurricane Andrew</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1050309","titles":{"canonical":"Hurricane_Andrew","normalized":"Hurricane Andrew","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Hurricane Andrew</span>"},"pageid":35999637,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Andrew_1992-08-23_1801Z.png/320px-Andrew_1992-08-23_1801Z.png","width":320,"height":427},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Andrew_1992-08-23_1801Z.png","width":1500,"height":2000},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1250347259","tid":"3800edcc-8689-11ef-ba88-d880c6de16d2","timestamp":"2024-10-09T21:55:38Z","description":"Category 5 Atlantic hurricane in 1992","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Andrew","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Andrew?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Andrew?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hurricane_Andrew"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Andrew","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Hurricane_Andrew","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Andrew?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hurricane_Andrew"}},"extract":"Hurricane Andrew was a tropical cyclone that struck the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana in August 1992.

He is noted particularly for his 1962 invention and first demonstration of a semiconductor laser diode that emitted visible light. This device was the forerunner of the first generation of commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs). He was then working at a General Electric research laboratory near Syracuse, New York. He left General Electric in 1963 and returned to his alma mater, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he later became John Bardeen Endowed Chair in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Physics.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Nick Holonyak"},{"type":"standard","title":"General_Electric","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">General Electric</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q54173","titles":{"canonical":"General_Electric","normalized":"General Electric","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">General Electric</span>"},"pageid":12730,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/General_Electric_logo.svg/320px-General_Electric_logo.svg.png","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/General_Electric_logo.svg/500px-General_Electric_logo.svg.png","width":500,"height":500},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1250374460","tid":"aef9cd18-86a8-11ef-8db9-a402fd9ccf6b","timestamp":"2024-10-10T01:40:52Z","description":"American multinational conglomerate (1892–2024)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:General_Electric"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/General_Electric","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:General_Electric"}},"extract":"General Electric Company (GE) was an American multinational conglomerate founded in 1892, incorporated in the state of New York and headquartered in Boston.
