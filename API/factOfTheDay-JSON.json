With the Australians unable to concentrate sufficient combat power to achieve a decisive result, the bulk of the VC/PAVN force successfully withdrew intact, although they probably sustained heavy casualties in the process.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Battle of Long Khánh"}],"year":1971},{"text":"World War II: Operation Overlord, the largest amphibious military operation in history, began with Allied troops landing on the beaches of Normandy in France.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"World_War_II","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">World War II</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q362","titles":{"canonical":"World_War_II","normalized":"World War II","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">World War II</span>"},"pageid":32927,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-646-5188-17%2C_Flugzeuge_Junkers_Ju_87.jpg/330px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-646-5188-17%2C_Flugzeuge_Junkers_Ju_87.jpg","width":320,"height":218},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-646-5188-17%2C_Flugzeuge_Junkers_Ju_87.jpg","width":798,"height":544},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1292318541","tid":"3ec35929-3a1b-11f0-9c93-a56b42a31d11","timestamp":"2025-05-26T10:21:54Z","description":"1939–1945 global conflict","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:World_War_II"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/World_War_II","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:World_War_II"}},"extract":"World War II or the Second World War was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies and the Axis powers.
