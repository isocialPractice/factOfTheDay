The main series follows their attempts to assist people who find themselves harassed by spirits, while the spin-off films focus on the origins of some of the entities the Warrens have encountered.</p>","normalizedtitle":"The Conjuring Universe"},{"views":85174,"rank":33,"view_history":[{"date":"2025-09-03Z","views":866},{"date":"2025-09-04Z","views":588302},{"date":"2025-09-05Z","views":349082},{"date":"2025-09-06Z","views":128968},{"date":"2025-09-07Z","views":85174}],"type":"standard","title":"Giorgio_Armani","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Giorgio Armani</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q157054","titles":{"canonical":"Giorgio_Armani","normalized":"Giorgio Armani","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Giorgio Armani</span>"},"pageid":406617,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Giorgio_Armani_1997.jpg/330px-Giorgio_Armani_1997.jpg","width":320,"height":455},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Giorgio_Armani_1997.jpg","width":2373,"height":3375},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1310148168","tid":"cd18b308-8c47-11f0-ab96-82109342a754","timestamp":"2025-09-08T00:07:26Z","description":"Italian fashion designer (1934–2025)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Armani","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Armani?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Armani?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Giorgio_Armani"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Armani","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Giorgio_Armani","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Armani?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Giorgio_Armani"}},"extract":"Giorgio Armani OMRI was an Italian fashion designer and founder of the Armani luxury fashion house.
