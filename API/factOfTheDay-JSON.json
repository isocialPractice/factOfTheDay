In addition, three summer and two winter editions of the games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war: Berlin (summer) in 1916; Sapporo–Garmisch-Partenkirchen (winter) and Tokyo–Helsinki (summer) in 1940; and Cortina d'Ampezzo (winter) and London (summer) in 1944. The 1906 Intercalated Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens. However, in 1949, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games. The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were postponed for the first time in the Olympics history to summer 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic with the 2022 Winter Olympics being held roughly six months later in Beijing.</p>","normalizedtitle":"List of Olympic Games host cities"},{"views":201988,"rank":18,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-07-24Z","views":134},{"date":"2024-07-25Z","views":105},{"date":"2024-07-26Z","views":135},{"date":"2024-07-27Z","views":538},{"date":"2024-07-28Z","views":201988}],"type":"standard","title":"2022_European_Athletics_Championships","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">2022 European Athletics Championships</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q74726761","titles":{"canonical":"2022_European_Athletics_Championships","normalized":"2022 European Athletics Championships","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">2022 European Athletics Championships</span>"},"pageid":70392902,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/2014_Olympiastadion_Munich.jpg/320px-2014_Olympiastadion_Munich.jpg","width":320,"height":159},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/2014_Olympiastadion_Munich.jpg","width":6553,"height":3253},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1228836218","tid":"ae655488-2986-11ef-98ff-ad28ddd5779b","timestamp":"2024-06-13T13:13:10Z","description":"International athletics championship event","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_European_Athletics_Championships","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_European_Athletics_Championships?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_European_Athletics_Championships?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2022_European_Athletics_Championships"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_European_Athletics_Championships","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/2022_European_Athletics_Championships","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_European_Athletics_Championships?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2022_European_Athletics_Championships"}},"extract":"The 2022 European Athletics Championships were the 25th edition of the European Athletics Championships and were held in Munich, Germany, from 15 to 21 August 2022.","extract_html":"<p>The <b>2022 European Athletics Championships</b> were the 25th edition of the European Athletics Championships and were held in Munich, Germany, from 15 to 21 August 2022.</p>","normalizedtitle":"2022 European Athletics Championships"},{"views":189303,"rank":19,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-07-24Z","views":39416},{"date":"2024-07-25Z","views":35112},{"date":"2024-07-26Z","views":327591},{"date":"2024-07-27Z","views":533173},{"date":"2024-07-28Z","views":189303}],"type":"standard","title":"Celine_Dion","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Celine Dion</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q5105","titles":{"canonical":"Celine_Dion","normalized":"Celine Dion","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Celine Dion</span>"},"pageid":203407,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/C%C3%A9line_Dion_2012.jpg/320px-C%C3%A9line_Dion_2012.jpg","width":320,"height":453},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/C%C3%A9line_Dion_2012.jpg","width":565,"height":800},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1237144155","tid":"abb97791-4cc8-11ef-a571-08139c691ba4","timestamp":"2024-07-28T10:03:43Z","description":"Canadian singer (born 1968)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Dion","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Dion?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Dion?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Celine_Dion"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Dion","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Celine_Dion","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine_Dion?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Celine_Dion"}},"extract":"Céline Marie Claudette Dion is a Canadian singer.
