Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of individuals who have served as president.</p>","normalizedtitle":"List of presidents of the United States"},{"views":481507,"rank":19,"view_history":[{"date":"2024-11-02Z","views":22565},{"date":"2024-11-03Z","views":29440},{"date":"2024-11-04Z","views":48621},{"date":"2024-11-05Z","views":166971},{"date":"2024-11-06Z","views":481507}],"type":"standard","title":"Red_states_and_blue_states","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Red states and blue states</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1190344","titles":{"canonical":"Red_states_and_blue_states","normalized":"Red states and blue states","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Red states and blue states</span>"},"pageid":1130657,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Red_state%2C_blue_state.svg/320px-Red_state%2C_blue_state.svg.png","width":320,"height":202},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Red_state%2C_blue_state.svg/940px-Red_state%2C_blue_state.svg.png","width":940,"height":593},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1255655673","tid":"6b2aa367-9bd7-11ef-b28b-61a5f4bca846","timestamp":"2024-11-06T00:38:19Z","description":"U.S. states that vote predominantly for Democrats (blue) or Republicans (red)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Red_states_and_blue_states"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Red_states_and_blue_states","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Red_states_and_blue_states"}},"extract":"Starting with the 2000 United States presidential election, the terms \"red state\" and \"blue state\" have referred to US states whose voters vote predominantly for one party—the Republican Party in red states and the Democratic Party in blue states—in presidential and other statewide elections.
