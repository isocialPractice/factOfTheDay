The stated intent of the expedition was to recapture the Muslim-controlled city of Jerusalem, by first defeating the powerful Egyptian Ayyubid Sultanate. However, a sequence of economic and political events culminated in the Crusader army's 1202 siege of Zara and the 1204 sack of Constantinople, rather than the conquest of Egypt as originally planned. This led to the partition of the Byzantine Empire by the Crusaders and their Venetian allies, leading to a period known as the <i>Frankokratia</i>.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Fourth Crusade"},{"type":"standard","title":"Siege_of_Zara","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Siege of Zara</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q604739","titles":{"canonical":"Siege_of_Zara","normalized":"Siege of Zara","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Siege of Zara</span>"},"pageid":4000356,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Siege_of_Zadar.jpg/330px-Siege_of_Zadar.jpg","width":320,"height":450},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Siege_of_Zadar.jpg","width":1000,"height":1406},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1321158489","tid":"cc180847-bd08-11f0-9021-6349dc240fe1","timestamp":"2025-11-09T01:09:53Z","description":"Part of the Fourth Crusade","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":44.11416667,"lon":15.22777778},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Zara","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Zara?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Zara?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Siege_of_Zara"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Zara","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Siege_of_Zara","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Zara?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Siege_of_Zara"}},"extract":"The siege of Zara or siege of Zadar was the first major action of the Fourth Crusade and the first attack against a Catholic city by Catholic crusaders.
