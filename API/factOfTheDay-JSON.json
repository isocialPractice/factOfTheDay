In ice hockey, two opposing teams use ice hockey sticks to control, advance, and shoot a closed, vulcanized, rubber disc called a \"puck\" into the other team's goal. Each goal is worth one point. The team which scores the most goals is declared the winner. In a formal game, each team has six skaters on the ice at a time, barring any penalties, one of whom is the goaltender. Ice hockey is a full contact sport, and is considered to be one of the more physically demanding team sports. It is distinct from field hockey, in which players move a ball around a non-frozen pitch using field hockey sticks.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Ice hockey"},{"type":"standard","title":"Victoria_Skating_Rink","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Victoria Skating Rink</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2522830","titles":{"canonical":"Victoria_Skating_Rink","normalized":"Victoria Skating Rink","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Victoria Skating Rink</span>"},"pageid":8468896,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Skating_carnival_Montreal_by_Notman.jpg/320px-Skating_carnival_Montreal_by_Notman.jpg","width":320,"height":232},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Skating_carnival_Montreal_by_Notman.jpg","width":742,"height":537},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1198252753","tid":"0c2b4e40-d8bc-11ee-b916-458690da9737","timestamp":"2024-01-23T16:27:10Z","description":"Former indoor ice skating rink in Montreal","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":45.498,"lon":-73.5724},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Skating_Rink","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Skating_Rink?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Skating_Rink?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Victoria_Skating_Rink"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Skating_Rink","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Victoria_Skating_Rink","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Skating_Rink?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Victoria_Skating_Rink"}},"extract":"The Victoria Skating Rink was an indoor ice skating rink located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
