It holds that the Islamic prophet Muhammad designated ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib as his successor (<i>khalīfa</i>) and the Imam after him, most notably at the event of Ghadir Khumm, but was prevented from succeeding Muhammad as the leader of the Muslims as a result of the choice made by some of Muhammad's other companions (<i>ṣaḥāba</i>) at Saqifah. This view primarily contrasts with that of Sunnī Islam, whose adherents believe that Muhammad did not appoint a successor before his death and consider Abū Bakr, who was appointed caliph by a group of Muhammad's other companions at Saqifah, to be the first rightful (<i>rāshidūn</i>) caliph after Muhammad.
