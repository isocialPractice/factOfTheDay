The war was fought between the Red Guards, led by a section of the Social Democratic Party, and the White Guards, conducted by the senate and those who opposed socialism with assistance late in the war by the German Imperial Army at the request of the Finnish civil government. The paramilitary Red Guards, which were composed of industrial and agrarian workers, controlled the cities and industrial centres of southern Finland.

In an analogous way to the governor-general of Australia at the national level, the governors of the Australian states perform constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level. The governor is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the premier of New South Wales, and serves in office for an unfixed period of time—known as serving <i>At His Majesty's pleasure</i>—though five years is the general standard of office term. The current governor is retired judge Margaret Beazley, who succeeded David Hurley on 2 May 2019.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Governor of New South Wales"},{"type":"standard","title":"Rum_Rebellion","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Rum Rebellion</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2065299","titles":{"canonical":"Rum_Rebellion","normalized":"Rum Rebellion","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Rum Rebellion</span>"},"pageid":52741,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Arrest_of_Govenor_Bligh.jpg/320px-Arrest_of_Govenor_Bligh.jpg","width":320,"height":197},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Arrest_of_Govenor_Bligh.jpg","width":1372,"height":846},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1199130444","tid":"7aaaa750-bbf5-11ee-b235-03bce75e3665","timestamp":"2024-01-26T02:49:06Z","description":"1808 coup in Britain's New South Wales Colony","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum_Rebellion","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum_Rebellion?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum_Rebellion?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rum_Rebellion"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum_Rebellion","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Rum_Rebellion","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum_Rebellion?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rum_Rebellion"}},"extract":"The Rum Rebellion of 1808 was a coup d'état in the then-British penal colony of New South Wales, staged by the New South Wales Corps in order to depose Governor William Bligh.
