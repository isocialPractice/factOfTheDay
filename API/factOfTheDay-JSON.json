As a title, <i>princeps</i> originated in the Roman Republic wherein the leading member of the Senate was designated <i>princeps senatus</i>. It is primarily associated with the Roman emperors as an unofficial title first adopted by Augustus in 23 BC. Its use in this context continued until the regime of Diocletian at the end of the third century. He preferred the title of <i>dominus</i>, meaning \"lord\" or \"master\". As a result, the Roman Empire from Augustus to Diocletian is termed the \"principate\" (<i>principatus</i>). Other historians define the reign of Augustus to Severus Alexander as the Principate, and the period afterwards as the \"Autocracy\".</p>","normalizedtitle":"Princeps"},{"type":"standard","title":"Roman_Senate","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Roman Senate</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q130614","titles":{"canonical":"Roman_Senate","normalized":"Roman Senate","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Roman Senate</span>"},"pageid":16685964,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Roman_SPQR_banner.svg/320px-Roman_SPQR_banner.svg.png","width":320,"height":254},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Roman_SPQR_banner.svg/289px-Roman_SPQR_banner.svg.png","width":289,"height":229},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1195185532","tid":"c1a48a20-b175-11ee-8b32-71a3081a4fd4","timestamp":"2024-01-12T18:09:37Z","description":"Political institution in ancient Rome","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Roman_Senate"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Roman_Senate","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Roman_Senate"}},"extract":"The Roman Senate was the highest and constituting assembly of ancient Rome and its aristocracy.
