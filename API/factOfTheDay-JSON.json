The series is set during the early 19th century in an alternative London Regency era, in which George III established racial equality and granted aristocratic titles to people of color due to the African heritage of his wife, Queen Charlotte.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Bridgerton"},{"views":107085,"rank":40,"view_history":[{"date":"2026-01-29Z","views":10187},{"date":"2026-01-30Z","views":10659},{"date":"2026-01-31Z","views":10688},{"date":"2026-02-01Z","views":14211},{"date":"2026-02-02Z","views":107085}],"type":"standard","title":"Lady_Gaga","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Lady Gaga</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q19848","titles":{"canonical":"Lady_Gaga","normalized":"Lady Gaga","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Lady Gaga</span>"},"pageid":17782843,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Lady_Gaga_at_Joe_Biden%27s_inauguration_%28cropped_5%29.jpg/330px-Lady_Gaga_at_Joe_Biden%27s_inauguration_%28cropped_5%29.jpg","width":330,"height":484},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Lady_Gaga_at_Joe_Biden%27s_inauguration_%28cropped_5%29.jpg","width":2454,"height":3600},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1336293337","tid":"6f23b6db-0093-11f1-9e92-86eeab61cd77","timestamp":"2026-02-03T00:01:05Z","description":"American singer, songwriter and actress (born 1986)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lady_Gaga"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Lady_Gaga","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lady_Gaga"}},"extract":"Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, known professionally as Lady Gaga, is an American singer, songwriter, and actress.
