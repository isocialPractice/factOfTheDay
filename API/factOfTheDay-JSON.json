Dugard remained missing for over 18 years until 2009, when a convicted sex offender, Phillip Garrido, visited the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, accompanied by two adolescent girls, who were discovered to be the biological daughters of Garrido and Dugard, on August 24 and 25 of that year. The unusual behavior of the trio sparked an investigation that led Garrido's parole officer, Edward Santos Jr, to order Garrido to take the two girls to a parole office in Concord, California, on August 26. Garrido was accompanied by a woman who was eventually identified as Dugard.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard"},{"type":"standard","title":"South_Lake_Tahoe,_California","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">South Lake Tahoe, California</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q983602","titles":{"canonical":"South_Lake_Tahoe,_California","normalized":"South Lake Tahoe, California","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">South Lake Tahoe, California</span>"},"pageid":116844,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/South_Lake_Tahoe_Skyline.JPG/330px-South_Lake_Tahoe_Skyline.JPG","width":320,"height":230},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/South_Lake_Tahoe_Skyline.JPG","width":3149,"height":2261},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1291713550","tid":"2d4e25a4-375f-11f0-a9f1-b43caf8c7f0e","timestamp":"2025-05-22T22:50:37Z","description":"City in California, United States","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":38.94,"lon":-119.97694444},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lake_Tahoe%2C_California","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lake_Tahoe%2C_California?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lake_Tahoe%2C_California?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:South_Lake_Tahoe%2C_California"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lake_Tahoe%2C_California","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/South_Lake_Tahoe%2C_California","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lake_Tahoe%2C_California?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:South_Lake_Tahoe%2C_California"}},"extract":"South Lake Tahoe is the most populous incorporated city in El Dorado County, California, United States, in the Sierra Nevada mountains.
