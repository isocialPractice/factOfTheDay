These included a book on polar explorations by Daniel Snowman and an article on urology by researchers named Splatt and Weedon.

French victories in the upper Danubian territories opened a route along that river to Vienna.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Battle of Neuburg (1800)"},{"type":"standard","title":"Danube","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Danube</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1653","titles":{"canonical":"Danube","normalized":"Danube","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Danube</span>"},"pageid":21209639,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/View_from_Gell%C3%A9rt_Hill_to_the_Danube%2C_Hungary_-_Budapest_%2828493220635%29.jpg/330px-View_from_Gell%C3%A9rt_Hill_to_the_Danube%2C_Hungary_-_Budapest_%2828493220635%29.jpg","width":320,"height":166},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/View_from_Gell%C3%A9rt_Hill_to_the_Danube%2C_Hungary_-_Budapest_%2828493220635%29.jpg","width":2500,"height":1293},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1296993055","tid":"75a079a9-5042-11f0-8d46-8064a9d4c176","timestamp":"2025-06-23T14:58:02Z","description":"Second-longest river in Europe","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":45.2175,"lon":29.76138889},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Danube"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Danube","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Danube"}},"extract":"The Danube is the second-longest river in Europe, after the Volga in Russia.

A fourth quadrangle was completed in 2021.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Jesus College, Oxford"},{"type":"standard","title":"Protestantism_in_the_United_Kingdom","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Protestantism in the United Kingdom</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q7251676","titles":{"canonical":"Protestantism_in_the_United_Kingdom","normalized":"Protestantism in the United Kingdom","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Protestantism in the United Kingdom</span>"},"pageid":16408640,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1293799503","tid":"61ee9df3-40ae-11f0-aab0-809e8078bb15","timestamp":"2025-06-03T19:10:16Z","description":"Overview of the role of Protestantism in the United Kingdom","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism_in_the_United_Kingdom","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism_in_the_United_Kingdom?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism_in_the_United_Kingdom?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Protestantism_in_the_United_Kingdom"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism_in_the_United_Kingdom","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Protestantism_in_the_United_Kingdom","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism_in_the_United_Kingdom?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Protestantism_in_the_United_Kingdom"}},"extract":"Protestantism is the largest religious demographic in the United Kingdom.","extract_html":"<p>Protestantism is the largest religious demographic in the United Kingdom.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Protestantism in the United Kingdom"},{"type":"standard","title":"University_of_Oxford","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">University of Oxford</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q34433","titles":{"canonical":"University_of_Oxford","normalized":"University of Oxford","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">University of Oxford</span>"},"pageid":31797,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Arms_of_University_of_Oxford.svg/330px-Arms_of_University_of_Oxford.svg.png","width":320,"height":385},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Arms_of_University_of_Oxford.svg/500px-Arms_of_University_of_Oxford.svg.png","width":500,"height":602},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1297509291","tid":"86a1f4de-52af-11f0-a387-68d2ac3c64f7","timestamp":"2025-06-26T17:03:48Z","description":"Collegiate university in Oxford, England","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":51.755,"lon":-1.255},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:University_of_Oxford"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/University_of_Oxford","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:University_of_Oxford"}},"extract":"The University of Oxford is a collegiate research university in Oxford, England.
