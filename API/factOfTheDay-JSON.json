The UK withdrew from the European Union (EU) in January 2020. A year later, in January 2021, the party was renamed Reform UK. During the COVID-19 pandemic the party advocated against further lockdowns. Since 2022, it has campaigned on a broader platform, in particular pledging to reduce net migration, supporting low taxation, and opposing the government's net-zero energy policy. Following Nigel Farage's resumption of the party leadership in early June during the 2024 general election campaign, opinion pollsters and analysts reported an increase in support for the party.","extract_html":"<p><b>Reform UK</b> is a right-wing populist political party in the United Kingdom.
