He maintained a band of subordinates for most of his career. He was a flamboyant, high-profile criminal, attacking the police at least as often as they sought him. In addition, he was a local power-broker in Sicilian politics between 1945 and 1948, including his role as a nominal colonel for the Movement for the Independence of Sicily. He and his band were held legally responsible for the Portella della Ginestra massacre, though there is some doubt about their role in the numerous deaths which occurred.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Salvatore Giuliano"},{"type":"standard","title":"Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Portella della Ginestra massacre</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2914382","titles":{"canonical":"Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre","normalized":"Portella della Ginestra massacre","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Portella della Ginestra massacre</span>"},"pageid":13568174,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e5/Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre_%28photo_of_mural%29.jpg/330px-Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre_%28photo_of_mural%29.jpg","width":320,"height":211},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e5/Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre_%28photo_of_mural%29.jpg","width":426,"height":281},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1284711464","tid":"7ed57ea3-1512-11f0-9021-f7fc3dec7994","timestamp":"2025-04-09T07:16:03Z","description":"1947 mass killing by Sicilian separatists in Piana degli Albanesi, Sicily, Italy","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":37.97611111,"lon":13.25611111},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre"}},"extract":"The Portella della Ginestra massacre refers to the killing of 11 people and wounding of 27 others during May Day celebrations in Sicily on 1 May 1947, in the municipality of Piana degli Albanesi.
