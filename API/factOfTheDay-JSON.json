Sometimes called a \"living fossil\", it is the only extant representative of the family Mitsukurinidae, a lineage some 125 million years old. This pink-skinned animal has a distinctive profile with an elongated, flat snout, and highly protrusible jaws containing prominent nail-like teeth. It is usually between 3 and 4 m long when mature, though it can grow considerably larger such as one captured in 2000 that is thought to have measured 6 m (20 ft). Goblin sharks are benthopelagic creatures that inhabit upper continental slopes, submarine canyons, and seamounts throughout the world at depths greater than 100 m (330 ft), with adults found deeper than juveniles. Some researchers believed that these sharks could also dive to depths of up to 1,300 m (4,270 ft), for short periods of time. However, footage captured in 2024 suggests that their range could be deeper than previously thought, with a confirmed sighting of an adult swimming at 2,000 m (6,560 ft).","extract_html":"<p>The <b>goblin shark</b> is a rare species of deep-sea shark.

A leading figure in the pop art movement, Warhol is considered one of the most important American artists of the second half of the 20th century. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, advertising, and celebrity culture that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, sculpture, photography, and filmmaking. Some of his best-known works include the silkscreen paintings <i>Campbell's Soup Cans</i> (1962) and <i>Marilyn Diptych</i> (1962), the experimental film <i>Chelsea Girls</i> (1966), the multimedia events known as the <i>Exploding Plastic Inevitable</i> (1966–67), and the erotic film <i>Blue Movie</i> (1969) that started the \"Golden Age of Porn\".</p>","normalizedtitle":"Andy Warhol"},{"type":"standard","title":"Campbell's_Soup_Cans","displaytitle":"<i>Campbell's Soup Cans</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2697937","titles":{"canonical":"Campbell's_Soup_Cans","normalized":"Campbell's Soup Cans","display":"<i>Campbell's Soup Cans</i>"},"pageid":7536709,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Campbell%27s_Soup_Cans_by_Andy_Warhol.jpg/330px-Campbell%27s_Soup_Cans_by_Andy_Warhol.jpg","width":320,"height":186},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Campbell%27s_Soup_Cans_by_Andy_Warhol.jpg","width":2604,"height":1514},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1297771778","tid":"17dcaa80-5411-11f0-b967-4b9850b96256","timestamp":"2025-06-28T11:14:44Z","description":"1962 artwork by Andy Warhol","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell's_Soup_Cans","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell's_Soup_Cans?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell's_Soup_Cans?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Campbell's_Soup_Cans"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell's_Soup_Cans","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Campbell's_Soup_Cans","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell's_Soup_Cans?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Campbell's_Soup_Cans"}},"extract":"Campbell's Soup Cans is a work of art produced between November 1961 and June 1962 by the American artist Andy Warhol.
