His proposition that all species of life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally accepted and considered a fundamental concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history and was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Charles Darwin"},{"type":"standard","title":"On_the_Tendency_of_Species_to_form_Varieties;_and_on_the_Perpetuation_of_Varieties_and_Species_by_Natural_Means_of_Selection","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1801903","titles":{"canonical":"On_the_Tendency_of_Species_to_form_Varieties;_and_on_the_Perpetuation_of_Varieties_and_Species_by_Natural_Means_of_Selection","normalized":"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection</span>"},"pageid":856170,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1226394339","tid":"82b76b62-1e70-11ef-bec5-ace4becd4e9c","timestamp":"2024-05-30T10:36:45Z","description":"Journal article","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Tendency_of_Species_to_form_Varieties%3B_and_on_the_Perpetuation_of_Varieties_and_Species_by_Natural_Means_of_Selection","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Tendency_of_Species_to_form_Varieties%3B_and_on_the_Perpetuation_of_Varieties_and_Species_by_Natural_Means_of_Selection?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Tendency_of_Species_to_form_Varieties%3B_and_on_the_Perpetuation_of_Varieties_and_Species_by_Natural_Means_of_Selection?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:On_the_Tendency_of_Species_to_form_Varieties%3B_and_on_the_Perpetuation_of_Varieties_and_Species_by_Natural_Means_of_Selection"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Tendency_of_Species_to_form_Varieties%3B_and_on_the_Perpetuation_of_Varieties_and_Species_by_Natural_Means_of_Selection","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/On_the_Tendency_of_Species_to_form_Varieties%3B_and_on_the_Perpetuation_of_Varieties_and_Species_by_Natural_Means_of_Selection","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Tendency_of_Species_to_form_Varieties%3B_and_on_the_Perpetuation_of_Varieties_and_Species_by_Natural_Means_of_Selection?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:On_the_Tendency_of_Species_to_form_Varieties%3B_and_on_the_Perpetuation_of_Varieties_and_Species_by_Natural_Means_of_Selection"}},"extract":"\n\n\"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection\" is the title of a journal article, comprising and resulting from the joint presentation of two scientific papers to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858: On The Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type by Alfred Russel Wallace and an Extract from an unpublished Work on Species from Charles Darwin's Essay of 1844.
