The system has a hierarchical format with promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels, allowing even the smallest club the theoretical possibility of ultimately rising to the very top of the system, the Premier League. Below that are levels 2–4 organised by the English Football League, then the National League System from levels 5–10 administered by the FA, and thereafter Regional feeder leagues run by relevant county FAs on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. It also often happens that the Premier Division of a Regional Feeder League has its constitution given to it by the FA. They have to accept it or appeal but cannot reject it at an annual general meeting.</p>","normalizedtitle":"English football league system"},{"type":"standard","title":"Sutton_United_2–1_Coventry_City_(1989)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Sutton United 2–1 Coventry City (1989)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q7650334","titles":{"canonical":"Sutton_United_2–1_Coventry_City_(1989)","normalized":"Sutton United 2–1 Coventry City (1989)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Sutton United 2–1 Coventry City (1989)</span>"},"pageid":29029343,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Gander_green_lane.JPG/320px-Gander_green_lane.JPG","width":320,"height":205},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Gander_green_lane.JPG","width":1501,"height":961},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1177465081","tid":"bda4471a-5d5f-11ee-a831-91ebffd4cacb","timestamp":"2023-09-27T18:00:28Z","description":"Association football match","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_United_2%E2%80%931_Coventry_City_(1989)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_United_2%E2%80%931_Coventry_City_(1989)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_United_2%E2%80%931_Coventry_City_(1989)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sutton_United_2%E2%80%931_Coventry_City_(1989)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_United_2%E2%80%931_Coventry_City_(1989)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Sutton_United_2%E2%80%931_Coventry_City_(1989)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_United_2%E2%80%931_Coventry_City_(1989)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sutton_United_2%E2%80%931_Coventry_City_(1989)"}},"extract":"The 1988–89 FA Cup third-round match between Sutton United and Coventry City was an association football game played at Gander Green Lane in Sutton, on 7 January 1989.

They are the most readily visible Solar System objects after Saturn, the dimmest of the classical planets; though their closeness to bright Jupiter makes naked-eye observation very difficult, they are readily seen with common binoculars, even under night sky conditions of high light pollution. The invention of the telescope enabled the discovery of the moons in 1610. Through this, they became the first Solar System objects discovered since humans have started tracking the classical planets, and the first objects to be found to orbit any planet beyond Earth.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Galilean moons"},{"type":"standard","title":"Io_(moon)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Io (moon)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3123","titles":{"canonical":"Io_(moon)","normalized":"Io (moon)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Io (moon)</span>"},"pageid":1051892,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Io_highest_resolution_true_color.jpg/320px-Io_highest_resolution_true_color.jpg","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Io_highest_resolution_true_color.jpg","width":3196,"height":3196},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1261379959","tid":"c8845714-b345-11ef-ae5f-42d52c8fd29d","timestamp":"2024-12-05T20:16:17Z","description":"Innermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Io_(moon)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Io_(moon)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Io_(moon)"}},"extract":"Io, or Jupiter I, is the innermost and second-smallest of the four Galilean moons of the planet Jupiter.
