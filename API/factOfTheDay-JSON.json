While the war was officially fought between North Vietnam and South Vietnam, the north was supported by the Soviet Union, China, and other communist states, while the south was supported by the United States and other anti-communist allies, making the war a proxy war between the United States and the Soviet Union. It lasted almost 20 years, with direct U.S. military involvement ending in 1973. The conflict also spilled over into neighboring states, exacerbating the Laotian Civil War and the Cambodian Civil War, which ended with all three countries officially becoming communist states by 1976.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Vietnam War"},{"type":"standard","title":"1st_Australian_Task_Force","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">1st Australian Task Force</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2876820","titles":{"canonical":"1st_Australian_Task_Force","normalized":"1st Australian Task Force","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">1st Australian Task Force</span>"},"pageid":3189882,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/RAR_Vietnam.jpg/320px-RAR_Vietnam.jpg","width":320,"height":402},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/RAR_Vietnam.jpg","width":600,"height":753},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1178676645","tid":"e2f0eca0-65da-11ee-8714-a51c83facb86","timestamp":"2023-10-05T04:52:54Z","description":"Joint military task force","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Australian_Task_Force","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Australian_Task_Force?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Australian_Task_Force?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:1st_Australian_Task_Force"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Australian_Task_Force","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/1st_Australian_Task_Force","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Australian_Task_Force?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:1st_Australian_Task_Force"}},"extract":"The 1st Australian Task Force was a brigade-sized formation which commanded Australian and New Zealand Army units deployed to South Vietnam between 1966 and 1972. 1 ATF was based in a rubber plantation at Nui Dat, 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) north of Bà Rịa in Phuoc Tuy Province and consisted of two and later three infantry battalions, with armour, aviation, engineers and artillery support.
