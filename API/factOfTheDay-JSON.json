This 2,700-year-old city played a key role in ancient times, when it was one of the major powers of the Mediterranean world. Syracuse is located in the southeast corner of the island of Sicily, next to the Gulf of Syracuse beside the Ionian Sea. It is situated in a drastic rise of land with 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) depths being close to the city offshore although the city itself is generally not so hilly in comparison.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Syracuse, Sicily"},{"type":"standard","title":"Siege_of_Syracuse_(877–878)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Siege of Syracuse (877–878)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q815213","titles":{"canonical":"Siege_of_Syracuse_(877–878)","normalized":"Siege of Syracuse (877–878)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Siege of Syracuse (877–878)</span>"},"pageid":31339576,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/MadridSkylitzesFol100vDetail.jpg/330px-MadridSkylitzesFol100vDetail.jpg","width":320,"height":236},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/MadridSkylitzesFol100vDetail.jpg","width":1160,"height":856},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1237433080","tid":"4fe30c24-4de2-11ef-b4e7-92047bea2dbf","timestamp":"2024-07-29T19:39:47Z","description":"Capture of Syracuse in Sicily by the Aghlabids","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":37.06,"lon":15.29416667},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Syracuse_(877%E2%80%93878)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Syracuse_(877%E2%80%93878)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Syracuse_(877%E2%80%93878)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Siege_of_Syracuse_(877%E2%80%93878)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Syracuse_(877%E2%80%93878)","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Siege_of_Syracuse_(877%E2%80%93878)","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Syracuse_(877%E2%80%93878)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Siege_of_Syracuse_(877%E2%80%93878)"}},"extract":"The siege of Syracuse from 877 to 878 led to the fall of the city of Syracuse, the Byzantine capital of Sicily, to the Aghlabids.
