When discussing or referring to Shakespeare's sonnets, it is almost always a reference to the 154 sonnets that were first published all together in a quarto in 1609. However, there are six additional sonnets that Shakespeare wrote and included in the plays <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>Henry V</i> and <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>. There is also a partial sonnet found in the play <i>Edward III</i>.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Shakespeare's sonnets"},{"type":"standard","title":"William_Shakespeare","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">William Shakespeare</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q692","titles":{"canonical":"William_Shakespeare","normalized":"William Shakespeare","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">William Shakespeare</span>"},"pageid":32897,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/William_Shakespeare_by_John_Taylor%2C_edited.jpg/330px-William_Shakespeare_by_John_Taylor%2C_edited.jpg","width":320,"height":408},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/William_Shakespeare_by_John_Taylor%2C_edited.jpg","width":2400,"height":3059},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1290898851","tid":"f80a95f8-335a-11f0-bb6e-cac7373ef924","timestamp":"2025-05-17T20:10:25Z","description":"English playwright and poet (1564–1616)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:William_Shakespeare"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/William_Shakespeare","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:William_Shakespeare"}},"extract":"William Shakespeare was an English playwright, poet and actor.
