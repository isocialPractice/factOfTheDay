In 1934, the island was converted into a federal prison, Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. The strong tidal currents around the island and ice-cold water temperatures made escape nearly impossible, giving the prison one of the most notorious reputations of its kind in American history. The prison closed on March 21, 1963, leaving the island a major tourist attraction today with nearly 1.4 million people visiting the island annually.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Alcatraz Island"},{"type":"standard","title":"San_Francisco_Bay","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">San Francisco Bay</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q232264","titles":{"canonical":"San_Francisco_Bay","normalized":"San Francisco Bay","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">San Francisco Bay</span>"},"pageid":26973,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Bay_Area_by_Sentinel-2%2C_2019-03-11_%28small_version%29.jpg/330px-Bay_Area_by_Sentinel-2%2C_2019-03-11_%28small_version%29.jpg","width":320,"height":338},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Bay_Area_by_Sentinel-2%2C_2019-03-11_%28small_version%29.jpg","width":10200,"height":10776},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1322338460","tid":"eba1bc14-c24d-11f0-8ceb-7c61027820fc","timestamp":"2025-11-15T18:07:17Z","description":"Shallow estuary on the coast of California, United States","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":37.67,"lon":-122.27},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:San_Francisco_Bay"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/San_Francisco_Bay","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:San_Francisco_Bay"}},"extract":"San Francisco Bay is a large tidal estuary in the U.S. state of California, and gives its name to the San Francisco Bay Area.

In 1783, in the Treaty of Paris, the British monarchy acknowledged the independence of the Thirteen Colonies, leading to the establishment of the United States as an independent and sovereign nation.</p>","normalizedtitle":"American Revolutionary War"},{"type":"standard","title":"Fort_Lee_Historic_Park","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Fort Lee Historic Park</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q5471502","titles":{"canonical":"Fort_Lee_Historic_Park","normalized":"Fort Lee Historic Park","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Fort Lee Historic Park</span>"},"pageid":3292241,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/FortLeeHistPark_04.JPG/330px-FortLeeHistPark_04.JPG","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/FortLeeHistPark_04.JPG","width":4608,"height":3456},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1304361784","tid":"402aaa9c-7212-11f0-a61c-93e5dfa6e781","timestamp":"2025-08-05T15:38:36Z","description":"Reconstructed historic site in Fort Lee, New Jersey, United States","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":40.8503,"lon":-73.963},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lee_Historic_Park","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lee_Historic_Park?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lee_Historic_Park?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Fort_Lee_Historic_Park"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lee_Historic_Park","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Fort_Lee_Historic_Park","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lee_Historic_Park?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Fort_Lee_Historic_Park"}},"extract":"Fort Lee Historic Park is located atop a bluff of the Hudson Palisades overlooking Burdett's Landing, known as Mount Constitution, in Fort Lee, New Jersey, United States.
