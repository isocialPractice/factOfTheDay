Most types of galleys also had sails that could be used in favourable winds, but they relied primarily on oars to move independently of winds and currents or in battle. The term \"galley\" originated from a Greek term for a small type of galley and came in use in English from about 1300. It has occasionally been used for unrelated vessels with similar military functions as galley but which were not Mediterranean in origin, such as medieval Scandinavian longships, 16th-century Acehnese ghalis and 18th-century North American gunboats.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Galley"}],"year":1646},{"text":"First English Civil War: Prince Maurice abandoned his siege of Lyme Regis in Dorset after learning of the approach of a Parliamentarian relief force.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"First_English_Civil_War","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">First English Civil War</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q3142505","titles":{"canonical":"First_English_Civil_War","normalized":"First English Civil War","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">First English Civil War</span>"},"pageid":1063738,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Battle_of_Marston_Moor_1644_by_John_Barker.png/330px-Battle_of_Marston_Moor_1644_by_John_Barker.png","width":320,"height":180},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Battle_of_Marston_Moor_1644_by_John_Barker.png","width":1920,"height":1080},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1289380213","tid":"dda61fa3-2bda-11f0-9ff6-54a5d5b80f6f","timestamp":"2025-05-08T07:05:47Z","description":"Part of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1642–1646)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_English_Civil_War","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_English_Civil_War?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_English_Civil_War?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:First_English_Civil_War"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_English_Civil_War","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/First_English_Civil_War","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_English_Civil_War?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:First_English_Civil_War"}},"extract":"The First English Civil War took place in England and Wales from 1642 to 1646, and forms part of the 1639 to 1653 Wars of the Three Kingdoms.
