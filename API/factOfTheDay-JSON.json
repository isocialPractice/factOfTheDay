He designed more than 1,000 structures over a creative period of 70 years. Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing architects worldwide through his works and mentoring hundreds of apprentices in his Taliesin Fellowship. Wright believed in designing in harmony with humanity and the environment, a philosophy he called <i>organic architecture</i>. This philosophy was exemplified in Fallingwater (1935), which has been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture\".</p>","normalizedtitle":"Frank Lloyd Wright"}],"year":1959},{"text":"World War II: The three-week-long Battle of Aachen concluded, making the city the first on German soil to be captured by the Allies.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"World_War_II","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">World War II</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q362","titles":{"canonical":"World_War_II","normalized":"World War II","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">World War II</span>"},"pageid":32927,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-646-5188-17%2C_Flugzeuge_Junkers_Ju_87.jpg/330px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-646-5188-17%2C_Flugzeuge_Junkers_Ju_87.jpg","width":320,"height":218},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-646-5188-17%2C_Flugzeuge_Junkers_Ju_87.jpg","width":798,"height":544},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1317937933","tid":"66bbaebe-ae09-11f0-a4ef-5f513d72ed6f","timestamp":"2025-10-20T23:06:25Z","description":"1939–1945 global conflict","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:World_War_II"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/World_War_II","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:World_War_II"}},"extract":"World War II or the Second World War was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies and the Axis powers.
